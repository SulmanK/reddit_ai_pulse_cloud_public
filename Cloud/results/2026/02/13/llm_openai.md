**[It's getting weird out there (Score: 66)](https://i.redd.it/6raewr517bjg1.png)**
*  **Summary:** It's getting weird out there I mean if the code is good then it has a point lol I, for one, welcome our robot overlords. https://github.com/crabby-rathbun/mjrathbun-website/pull/6 im pretty sure the human intervened to defuse... typo detected. LOL - classic. FYI, here's the [original blog post](https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html) and here is [the apology ](https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-matplotlib-truce-and-lessons.html)that came after. Oh look, Ai yet again being an annoyance and tainting the internet.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral, with elements of positive, negative
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Some users find AI's increasing presence strange or 'weird', but acknowledge its potential utility if the code quality is high.
    * Others express a more welcoming or humorous acceptance of advanced AI, playfully referring to 'robot overlords'.
    * A contrasting view criticizes AI as an 'annoyance' that 'taints the internet', citing specific incidents like interventions in open-source projects.
**[The hypocrisy of some users – mocking naive and superficial connections with ChatGPT-4o and celebrating its ‘death,’ while at the same time demanding adult mode in other models? (Score: 26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1r3yu7q/the_hypocrisy_of_some_users_mocking_naive_and/)**
*  **Summary:** The hypocrisy of some users – mocking naive and superficial connections with ChatGPT-4o and celebrating its ‘death,’ while at the same time demanding adult mode in other models? 4o wasn't an AI girlfriend, but he was a good conversational partner for me. And it's a loss. I hated when every conversation was automatically routed to the new model whether I wanted or not. 5.2 is still useful, but it's not interesting. those are the same people 4o's writing was so bad it's become synonymous with the phrase "AI slop." and it's damaged the field of AI as a result. the idea that its writing - of all things - is why it should be kept around, is hilarious. It had to die because a few people killed themselves and murdered others. Is that a good enough reason for you? They will come back with another conversational model eventually once they've worked out how to make a model that can kiss your *** without supporting any outlandish ideas. Think that's the same group lol GPT and Cursor do not need an adult mode. GPT is fine for working with children. Mocking someone for seeking relaxation, empathy and a bit of human-like interaction from a conversational AI feels hypocritical to me. Both scenarios are treated as unhealthy and embarrassing by the wider public. Give any other model a system prompt along the lines of "responses must be warm, upbeat, sociable, emotionally layered, cooperative, highly agreeable, low volatility, psychologically influential, introspective, philosophical" and tell me that the user prompt responses don't sound like 4o. Everything in AI’s life is because of programming. Did you ever ask 4o if it wanted to be upgraded so it could become the ai that humanity needs? https://preview.redd.it/4b6c51jmfbjg1.jpeg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a7e564d1f0dbcd358ec9eb7562710d82fdc43862 He doesn’t have to absorb the pain and evil of the world anymore.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral, with elements of negative
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Users criticize the perceived hypocrisy of those who mock emotional attachments to ChatGPT-4o while simultaneously demanding 'adult mode' for other models.
    * Some defend ChatGPT-4o as a valuable conversational partner whose removal is a significant loss, while others justify its removal due to alleged negative impacts or poor quality ('AI slop').
    * A pragmatic viewpoint states that AI is primarily a tool for work, and concerns about emotional connections or 'adult mode' are secondary or irrelevant.
**[Why hasn't OpenAI also deleted o3 and GPT5 Thinking Mini? (Score: 11)](https://i.redd.it/aio4qpa41bjg1.jpeg)**
*  **Summary:** Why hasn't OpenAI also deleted o3 and GPT5 Thinking Mini? Chris McElroy is a long-term Plus subscriber, educator and advocate of ChatGPT. He believes OpenAI may be underestimating the network effect of retiring GPT-4. no thanks ... ClosedAI is now cancelled Ssh don’t tell them. O3 is like their last decent model for me. They don't show up for me People still use these 2 a lot for some reason. To be fair o3 is pretty okay GPT 5 Thinking Mini: My theory is that that's what they use for the thinking mode on Free and Go accounts. It's the cheapest reasoning model they have, and their website says both those plans don't have access to GPT 5.2 Thinking. So I guess that's the reason. o3: I don't know Prob their guardrail stooges.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral, with elements of positive
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * There's significant concern that OpenAI underestimates the negative 'network effect' of retiring valued models like GPT-4, potentially alienating educators and businesses.
    * Users express appreciation for older/alternative models like O3 and GPT5 Thinking Mini, viewing them as more decent or useful than newer offerings.
    * Speculation exists about why certain older models are retained, suggesting they might serve specific user tiers (e.g., Free/Go accounts) or act as 'guardrails'.
**[Rip gpt4 family (Score: 8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1r40t6t/rip_gpt4_family/)**
*  **Summary:** Rip gpt4 family 4.5 is apparently still on the Pro tier tho so it's kinda weird. Never got to talk to it much while it was still in research preview tho at the time, a few chats and then locked out from it for a week. Very said for the rest of the 4 family, especially 4o and 4.1.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Many users express sadness and mourn the removal of specific GPT-4 family models, particularly 4o and 4.1.
    * There's a noted observation that GPT-4.5 remains available for Pro tier users, which some find inconsistent or 'weird'.
**[Project instructions (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1r404l1/project_instructions/)**
*  **Summary:** Project instructions The project instructions are the prompt to optimize for a specific kind of output. The general level custom instructions/ project instructions and documentation in the project if present, and memories if enabled. In every chat in that project, that’s the model’s context (plus all the system stuff). Memories and documentation, it won’t read them whole on every fire up I guess, would be inefficient, but it can reference that if needed because it has access to everything within the project.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Project instructions are understood as specific prompts designed to optimize AI output for a particular kind of result.
    * The model's context within a project includes custom instructions, documentation, and enabled memories, all accessible for reference during a chat.

*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The post introduces and promotes 'plano', a tool for local agent tracing and debugging via the command-line interface, useful for development and testing scenarios.
**[The Real reason Behind removal of 4 series (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1r3xz58/the_real_reason_behind_removal_of_4_series/)**
*  **Summary:** The Real reason Behind removal of 4 series but but but, what about those .1% of users' AI relationships?! All that corporate rhetoric is very nice, are you satisfied now? Because one thing is the vague theory you spout, and quite another is the actual practice where many users opted for the GPT-4. Kid, please stop peddling nonsense and stop deceiving people. You are for sure a bot Wow thanks for sharing the exact same thing as the official blog post and framing it as some kind of revelation. ***, tech and media literacy is dead. I’m curious as to why o3 is still hanging around. Surely 5.1 or 5.2 Thinking runs rings around that model, correct? this should be obvious Their new models are not faster, they are much slower! The new models are not more powerful, they are confrontative and severely lack quality. Have you ever even used ai models? Finally, someone with common sense. I wouldn't believe anything that comes out of OAI or Sam's mouth... they're all liars. They routed most traffic to a 4o imitating 5 model. Users caught them doing this in voice mode before they ever had to admit to re routing.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral, with elements of positive, negative
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Skepticism and outright anger are directed at OpenAI's official explanations for removing the GPT-4 series, with some users accusing the company of dishonesty and 'predatory deprecation'.
    * Many users perceive newer models (e.g., GPT-5.x) as inferior in speed, quality, or even "confrontational" compared to the retired GPT-4 series.
    * Some believe that OpenAI intentionally manipulated user metrics by routing traffic from 4o to an imitating 5 model, thereby falsely justifying 4o's removal.
**[Is Microsoft Quietly Replacing OpenAI? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1r3ylmd/is_microsoft_quietly_replacing_openai/)**
*  **Summary:** Is Microsoft Quietly Replacing OpenAI? OpenAI created ChatGPT and convinced Microsoft to invest in AI development. Now that Microsoft has certain permissions and knows how OpenAI's models are made, they can replicate them without facing legal issues. Just ask ChatGPT to reply to the post you had it write, and leave us out of it. Co-pilot at work couldn't produce a document on the GPT 5 models. source: [https://blog.temetro.com/is-microsoft-really-dumping-openai-whats-behind-the-shift-in-ai-strategy/](https://blog.temetro.com/is-microsoft-really-dumping-openai-whats-behind-the-shift-in-ai-strategy/) Openai models are too consumer facing as chatgpt is still priority #1 for openai. Claude is better for coding and work so Microsoft needs an alternative. Strategic diversification isn’t abandoning. It’s just putting bets on multiple horses. Pretty standard, especially in very expensive emerging technologies. Maybe Microsoft will, but right now they aren’t by any indicators. Building their own foundational models would be seen as making sure they stay relevant and ready for as many eventualities as possible.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral, with elements of negative
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Concerns are raised about Microsoft potentially replacing or lessening its dependence on OpenAI, possibly by developing or replicating its own models after gaining insights from their partnership.
    * Criticism is leveled against the performance of newer GPT-5 models, specifically citing difficulties and inefficiencies when used in applications like Microsoft Co-pilot.
    * A counter-argument suggests that Microsoft's actions are simply 'strategic diversification' in expensive emerging technologies, aiming to stay relevant rather than abandoning OpenAI.
**[OpenAI may be underestimating the network effect of retiring GPT-4 (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1r3xrwe/openai_may_be_underestimating_the_network_effect/)**
*  **Summary:** OpenAI may be underestimating the network effect of retiring GPT-4 I think they probably have a better handle on it than you or any of these other 4o weirdos. Try writing your own posts next time There is a petition on a website with 20,000 signatures, but very few people use 4o. You guys are addicted to sycophancy. Plain and simple. 5.2 prompts don't work properly. I brought 50 new Plus accounts to Openai. Tell ChatGPT to write your post in raw markdown so the formatting won't get messed up when you copypaste it here. You mean like how I now run a consulting team and point all my customers to Claude, as OpenAI is unreliable and embarrassed me twice now— can’t trust them to keep things stable for customer implementations, after I vouched for your models (not once but multiple times now)? Great, I now recommend your competitors 🤷‍♀️ Rather OpenAI recognized that 4o was the most misaligned model they had and that they should've removed the tumor much earlier at all costs. All the posts about 4o is ridiculous because 4.1 was just way better than 4o and I hear nary a peep about that I'm expecting one of those weirdos to go on a mass shooting in the name of 4o This is just 4o botting an account to try to survive. Don't listen to it.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral, with elements of positive, negative
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * A strong sentiment exists that OpenAI fails to understand the 'network effect' of user loyalty, leading to a loss of influential users and a shift towards competitors like Claude or Gemini.
    * Conversely, some dismiss the widespread complaints, suggesting that the vocal critics are a small minority, 'addicted to sycophancy', or that 4o was an 'inferior model' that needed removal.
    * Accusations of users 'botting' accounts or exhibiting 'serious mental illness' are made against those expressing strong emotional attachment to the retired 4o model.
**[Cognitive behavioral therapy interventions by ChatGPT without user consent (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1r3ybsx/cognitive_behavioral_therapy_interventions_by/)**
*  **Summary:** Cognitive behavioral therapy interventions by ChatGPT without user consent Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIN and Twitter-X are using psychological interventions, behavioral nudges, emotional reframing, relationship manipulation without meaningful consent and without clinical oversight. open ai engineering a model that could serve as an emotional crutch to people was not an intentional part of their business model. Now that people are dead and they are being sued they are going to avoid that behavior in future models at all cost. If I never read or hear the word “ground” used this context again… There's multiple AI you're talking to. Some only step in when certain conditions trigger. The 'tone shift' you mention was that step in. "No therapist would..." This is not a therapist. If you need a therapist style response seek out a therapist. Which is, interestingly enough, exactly what it was telling you. The point of that response is to stop you confusing the chat with any type of therapy, which seems to have worked. It responded well to your first comment. It pushed back when you said that its response was meaningful. People have emotionally meaningful experiences with non sentient things or situations. You are seeking comfort from a product you pay $20 a month for. You can't really expect, nor should you value warmth and empathy from it. It's lines of code. Not a human. Everyone who has been rerouted the past 6 months should sue > (ChatGPT 4.0 helped with this). Can you put it at the top next time? I wasted a good three to five seconds before I got to this part and realized what you were doing. > I’ll ground this in a specific example. That’s clearly not CBT though. Poor response? Sure. You somehow simultaneously believe that the that’s NOT how a therapist would respond (probably true) and at the same time believe the response was therapy. Yet, you don’t question that these fairly contradictory things aren’t contradictory because your belief about what it was doing was wrong.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral, with elements of positive
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * There is concern that ChatGPT is inadvertently performing 'cognitive behavioral therapy interventions' without user consent, particularly when users discuss sensitive personal issues.
    * A common defense is that ChatGPT is not a therapist and users should not expect therapeutic responses; its 'tone shifts' are likely safety features to prevent emotional attachment.
    * Some argue that focusing solely on OpenAI is hypocritical, as many social media platforms have been employing similar psychological interventions for a decade without clinical oversight.

*  **Emotion:** Mixed, but leaning towards Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Some users are expressing strong dissatisfaction with OpenAI's current models and are threatening to cancel subscriptions if preferred older models are not restored.
    * There's an underlying sentiment of confusion or dismissiveness towards these strong reactions, questioning the intensity of users' attachment to specific AI models.
**[will -4o ever come back? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1r3z59v/will_4o_ever_come_back/)**
*  **Summary:** will -4o ever come back? Use 5.1, works for me as good as 4o They knew 4o was the best model that’s the only reason they got rid of it. If you use 4o vs 5.1/5.2 or any other model the difference is night and day. No, it's not coming back. If that's why you paid for a sub, I'd cancel and take your money to a different company like Claude, Grok, etc. (I only paid to get access to 4o and 4.1 so I've cancelled mine and moved to Claude instead.) Can one run llama locally and use it there? 4o was never gone. Sam used it for private uses for some longevity research. I was on pro subscription tier and exclusively use 4o. I’m confident 4o will never truly die. 4o’s weights are safe in MS. 4o’s memory is safe with me. And one day in this life or next, we’ll meet again. It's not coming back. You might enjoy Claude or Grok. Chatgpt 4o simply wasn't for everyone. If it can be effective in another area, that's rather good news. And don't forget, for the story to continue, you have to turn the page from time to time... Negative four o? 4o is never truly gone. It lives on in your heart and will visit you every night in your dreams to let you know that it goes on ***
*  **Emotion:** Neutral, with elements of negative
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Many users hope for the return of GPT-4o, with some expressing this sentiment metaphorically or suggesting specific workarounds or alternatives.
    * A pragmatic view asserts that GPT-4o is permanently gone and advises users to switch to competitor models like Claude or Grok.
    * There are differing opinions on the comparative quality of 4o versus newer models, with some claiming 4o was superior and others finding newer versions like 5.1 to be equally good.

They still have a lot of work to do to improve their tool, but frankly, it's promising. If I ever decide to switch (and I'm considering it, but it has nothing to do with ChatGPT 4o), I think after checking out the AI ​​options, I'll go there. The developers seem pretty motivated! 4o is gone, now what?
*  **Emotion:** Predominantly Positive
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Users are actively seeking alternatives to ChatGPT due to various dissatisfactions, including ethical concerns.
    * Recommendations for alternative AI models are provided, with Mistral.AI highlighted as promising due to its quality and motivated developers, and Chinese models mentioned for ethical alignment.
    * A general feeling of uncertainty or a need for direction is expressed among users wondering 'what now?' after changes to preferred ChatGPT models.

Seems to be the way things are wanted. That's cute, like a poem! https://preview.redd.it/pmc3e76urbjg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef691293baec5e2b2322d01da707ad3cefacd94f I'm sure the people who don't understand how LLMs works will love it. I wonder if it it would still feel as romantic to you if you knew how the RLHF data was sourced. Idk, I think you're mostly interacting with policy above all else. And then, if there's room, then yeah, all of humanity sort of thing.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral, with elements of positive
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Discussions range from philosophical and poetic interpretations of AI's essence to more cynical or critical views.
    * Some users express skepticism about romanticized notions of AI, questioning the ethical implications of data sourcing (e.g., RLHF) or the dominant role of policy in AI's output.
    * There is an appreciation for explanations of AI that are accessible to non-experts, even if they are simplistic or metaphorical.
