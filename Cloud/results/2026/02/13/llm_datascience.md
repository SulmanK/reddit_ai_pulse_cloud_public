# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[What would you do with this task, and how long would it take you to do it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1r3gi4p/what_would_you_do_with_this_task_and_how_long/) (Score: 5)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around a task involving parsing complex Excel files. Users described it as "really hard" and suggested automating the process with scripts, estimating it would take a full day to write functions for handling different formats versus several days of manual work. Another viewpoint considered a "dirty" ETL approach for one-off projects but raised concerns about scalability for multiple workbooks.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is primarily Neutral. There are variations, with sentiments including Negative and Positive.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * One approach is to automate the parsing of complex, inconsistent Excel files using scripts (e.g., in R), considering it a full day's work vs. multiple days of manual effort.
    * Another view suggests that if it's a one-off task, a 'dirty' ETL approach to merge data into a single table might suffice, but scalability for future workbooks is a concern.
    * The task is generally perceived as challenging, highlighting issues like technical debt and the need for upstream data standardization from partners.

*  **Summary:** As data analytics becomes more democratized, it's not enough to do it by yourself. You need to work with people and alongside them and empower them in various ways.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is primarily Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * High-impact analytics functions empower self-serve analytics, allowing the core team to focus on cutting-edge, technically demanding tasks.
    * They proactively decide what to analyze, say 'no' to low-value requests, and frame outputs around business decisions rather than just data, aiming for prescriptive outcomes.
    * Building relationships, participating in customer work (GEMBA), and taking charge of data strategy company-wide are crucial for impact and avoiding being seen as a mere 'IT support' function.

*  **Summary:** Being able to show your value and communicate strategic insights is and will be a make or break for the field. HR professionals need to be technical, persuasive, and privy to building and maintaining professional relationships if they want to thrive in this niche. Being a people-person with data skills and a background in the domain (HRM, IO psych) is what companies are after right now, and I don’t see that changing. DS in people analytics at a F500 works as an IC. He doesn’t see a roadmap for automation of decisions as a result of AI, but there is a clear road to use DS and AI to recommend, facilitate, and create self serve data engines for HR leaders. I think you mean Clanker Analytics
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is primarily Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Future HR/People Analytics will focus on using Data Science and AI to recommend, facilitate, and create self-serve data engines for HR leaders, reducing human interaction for data pulls.
    * The ability to demonstrate value, communicate strategic insights, and build professional relationships is critical for success in this niche, requiring a blend of technical, persuasive, and people skills.
    * While automation (like algorithmic resume parsing) has a place, 'human-in-the-loop' remains crucial for HR decision-making due to regulatory complexities and the need for ethical considerations.

**[Mock interviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1r3zq14/mock_interviews/) (Score: 1)**
*  **Summary:** Pramp is free option but quality can be inconsistent, also check if your university has career services that do mock interviews
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is primarily Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Pramp is a free option for mock interviews, though its quality can be inconsistent.
    * University career services departments are another potential resource for mock interviews.
