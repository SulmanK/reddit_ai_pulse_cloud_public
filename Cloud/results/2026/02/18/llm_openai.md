*  **Summary:** TLDR; "come again???", lol. Does it work with simple bench and all the llm trap question ? didn’t work for me. 5.2 thinking still tells me to walk Hate to be reviewer2, but this was well known for at least 2 years: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06275> I'm gonna go get the papers get the papers Try 10x then That's crazy Before people start asking, the difference is that all tokens have the chance to attend each other when you repeat the prompt. So it's ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), well, kind of... Just add "**Re-read everything I said.**" at the end of your prompt. Tested in GPT 5.2 and Sonnet 4.6 Yes, I remember seeing this study a bit ago and forgot that I ever implemented it, great reminder But I've found it especially useful when rambling a weave of thoughts connecting different ideas, to end with giving a title to each topic at the end of the message so it gives a thorough response

*  **Summary:** you know what they say about Regex, if you try to solve a problem with Regex you now have two problems. you cant make a regex for everything. That’s the key things the tech bros and YouTubers with open mouth thumbnails haven’t figured out. For most AI applications, the outcome must be deterministic. LLM are an expensive form of computation. Most of that can be achieved at 1/1000th of the cost via deterministic scripts. Or you can train a NLP model for entity extraction Anyway I'm interested in the final matrix
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral (average score: 0.69). There are variations, with comments also expressing Positive.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Using powerful LLMs like Opus 4.6 for tasks that simpler, deterministic tools like regex could handle is inefficient and wasteful.
    * AI models, unlike deterministic scripts, lack guaranteed outcomes, audit trails, and reproducibility, making them unsuitable for applications requiring high precision.
    * While regex has limitations, alternative solutions like NLP models for entity extraction could be more appropriate than LLMs for certain tasks.
