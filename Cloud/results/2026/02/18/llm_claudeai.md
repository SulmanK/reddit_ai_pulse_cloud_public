    *   Update from Anthropic regarding the Agent SDK. Claude Island helps manage an application fork called Claude Island that puts Clawd and information in the macbook notch. Claude Island uses a plugin to augment claude code. Make up your ducking mind. still confused. why not just making login with claude So can we use clawdbot or not

    *   Anthropic bans OAuth tokens from consumer plans in third-party Tools Time to make a ton of requests so that Anthropic bans my account and gives me my money back so I can create a new account on a pro plan instead of max x20 lol dumb move So this kills any small time custom tools using it too it seems. RIP. Does that extend to tools using CC headless in their tool, or just custom tools built that use Oauth login to use the subscription alotments? This makes zero sense. The code for OAuth is the same regardless of whether Claude Code drafted it, or the dev wrote it themselves. I see no way Anthropic can actually enforce this. And claude code is closed source so you can’t switch to anything else sitting on a max plan. that sucks but at least it's finally been clarified. Never could get a straight answer in the past about whether using a subscription token in the SDK could get you banned.
*   4. [Are architecture diagrams dead?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1r8cxng/are_architecture_diagrams_dead/) (Score: 3)
    *   Are architecture diagrams dead? A stakeholder in the project I'm working on is a very visual person. They like diagrams and seeing how systems and vendors interconnect. The answer to your question is the common: it depends. Depends on who your audience is and what their preferences are. I hate diagrams. Even in school in science, I struggled to understand the information presented in diagrams. The humans still need to know what's going on, so there's value there. Even if it's not a visual diagram, having some kind of map of the project is going to make the LLM faster regardless of how much of the repo it can ingest in one go. quite the opposite, agents/claude are great at making architecture diagrams like with mermaid I get Claude to explain the repo with diagrams. ;)

    *   Getting anything I ever wanted stripped the joy away from me It doesn’t mean nothing. It means you’re being more efficient with your work. I get it that it might feel like you don’t have to challenge yourself since Claude helps so much, but that means you can just give yourself a challenge that’s outside your wheelhouse. I feel you. As humans we love to solve challenges, but we don't actually enjoy living in a world where challenges are already solved.

This is so bad and gooner levels We need regulation and laws on this she has a phone in each hand. This isn’t better than smaller models doing the same thing.

No man, I make sure the code Claude generates for me is of same quality or higher than code I would personally write myself by having a substantial amount of code review processes in place, etc. Period. Quality can not suffer, just because I am using a tool to write my code faster. The only "real" code is the one that executes directly on the hardware. Everything else is an abstraction to make it easy for humans to write something that will translate to the executable.
