# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Not quite sure how to think of the paradigm shift to LLM-focused solution (Score: 22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1r8dcx8/not_quite_sure_how_to_think_of_the_paradigm_shift/)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion revolves around the increasing focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) in data science. Many commenters share experiences of companies pushing for "AI" products, often LLM-based, sometimes without clear technical feasibility or understanding. There's a debate about whether LLMs represent a genuinely advanced or merely a hyped solution, with some data scientists feeling a sense of "humiliation" or boredom with the shift, while others pragmatically accept prompt engineering as the most efficient approach for certain tasks.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is predominantly **negative**, characterized by **frustration, skepticism, and cynicism**. Many users express dissatisfaction with the perceived simplification of data science roles to prompt engineering, the corporate hype around "AI" for marketing purposes, and concerns about the ethical implications or technical limitations of LLMs, especially in critical sectors like healthcare. There are some neutral observations regarding the efficiency of LLMs for specific tasks, but the underlying sentiment leans heavily towards dissatisfaction with the current industry direction.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   **Skepticism and Dislike for LLM-focused work:** Many data scientists express that working with LLMs is "boring," "humiliating," or involves too much "infra, dev, and prompt engineering" with frustrating outcomes like hallucinations. They prefer more traditional or technically challenging ML tasks and question the actual value vs. the hype.
    *   **Business Pressure and Hype-Driven Adoption:** Companies are observed to be pushing for "AI" (specifically LLM) solutions primarily for sales and marketing, sometimes mandating their use even when traditional ML or other solutions might be more appropriate or feasible given team resources and scope.
    *   **Pragmatic Acceptance of LLMs for NLP:** A contrasting view suggests that for natural language tasks, prompt engineering with LLMs offers the "best ROI" and that resistance comes from a desire for "technically challenging/interesting" work rather than the most effective business solution. This viewpoint acknowledges the business reality and efficiency of LLMs for specific applications.
