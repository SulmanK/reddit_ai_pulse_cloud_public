*  **Summary:**  This discussion explores why data engineers might want to leave the field. Common reasons include the role being thankless and invisible to higher-ups, unclear job boundaries leading to multiple responsibilities (DE, analytics, analyst), and the field being less "glamorous" than data science or machine learning. Some engineers enter DE accidentally, viewing it as a stepping stone. Challenges such as inheriting projects already behind schedule and the perception of being blamed by data scientists also contribute to dissatisfaction. Conversely, some enjoy DE, finding it a robust job market, and note that Reddit often amplifies complaints.
*  **Emotion:** The overall tone is predominantly Neutral. Distribution: Neutral (70.0%), Positive (30.0%). The discussion is largely neutral and analytical, presenting various perspectives on the challenges and nature of data engineering, though some positive comments express enjoyment or confidence in the field.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Many data engineers feel the role is thankless, invisible to upper management, and lacks the "glory" of other tech roles like data science or ML.
    * The role often involves unclear boundaries, leading data engineers to perform multiple functions (DE, analytics engineer, and analyst), which can cause burnout.
    * The perception of DE as a stepping stone to more "glamorous" roles like model building, and the challenges of being brought into projects already behind schedule, contribute to the desire to switch.

    * Success in DS/ML is highly dependent on a strong understanding of statistics, more so than just coding skills.
    * The field is fast-moving, and continuous learning is emphasized, with some individuals feeling "stuck" due to academic background constraints but aiming for less demanding roles.
**[How do mature teams handle environment drift in data platforms? (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r7zvtx/how_do_mature_teams_handle_environment_drift_in/)**
*  **Summary:**  This thread addresses the challenge of environment drift in data platforms, particularly when ingesting user-uploaded data. Solutions discussed include enforcing data contracts, implementing pre-checks before data loading, and using file types with schemas other than CSVs. Strategies involve having raw and staging storage, rejecting data that doesn't match expected schemas, and creating separate ingestion pipelines for each file. There's also mention of tracking the cost of fixing schema drift, "naming and shaming" sources of bad data, and assigning responsibility for data quality to BAs/FAs who work with source stakeholders.
*  **Emotion:** The overall tone is predominantly Neutral. Distribution: Neutral (75.0%), Positive (12.5%), Negative (12.5%). The discussion is largely neutral and solution-oriented, offering practical advice, with a slight undertone of frustration indicated by the negative comment.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Enforcing data contracts and performing pre-checks on data loading are crucial to prevent schema drift and ensure data quality, especially with user-uploaded data.
    * Implementing mechanisms to reject non-conforming data and automating error notifications to source owners helps manage drift effectively.
    * Shifting responsibility for data quality to business analysts/functional analysts and source stakeholders, along with tracking costs of fixing issues, can incentivize better data practices.
**[What is the one project you'd complete if management gave you a blank check? (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r85lfx/what_is_the_one_project_youd_complete_if/)**
*  **Summary:**  Users share their dream projects if given unlimited resources. Recurring themes include completely rebuilding existing, poorly designed data warehouses and pipelines from scratch to fix "junk code" and address technical debt. Other suggestions involve improving core infrastructure by replacing tools like GitHub Actions with Apache Airflow and enabling better data partitioning and CUD timestamps. A significant point of frustration highlighted is the need to overhaul bad API integrations (e.g., with Netsuite) that lead to immense manual correction efforts and operational costs.
