# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[AI Was Meant to Free Workers, But Startup Employees Are Working 12-Hour Days (Score: 87)](https://www.interviewquery.com/p/ai-startup-12-hour-workdays)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion centers on the reality that AI, contrary to expectations, has not led to increased free time for workers, particularly in startups where 12-hour days are common. Many users drew parallels to historical technological advancements, arguing that innovation often benefits employers by increasing output or replacing jobs rather than improving employee work-life balance.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is predominantly **Neutral**, but with a strong undercurrent of **Cynicism** and **Skepticism**. While individual comments are rated neutral, the collective sentiment reflects a critical view of AI's societal impact on labor, expressing disbelief in the idea that AI would "free workers" and highlighting the continuous demand for increased productivity.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   AI, like past technologies, primarily serves to increase output for owners, replace jobs, or intensify work, rather than inherently leading to more free time for workers.
    *   Long working hours are characteristic of startup culture, and AI merely accelerates prototyping or changes the scope of work, not necessarily the underlying expectation of intense labor.
    *   The "Jevons Paradox" is at play: increased efficiency from AI can lead to higher demand or more complex tasks, ultimately resulting in more work rather than less.

**[Was my modeling approach in this interview flawed, or was I rejected for other reasons? (Score: 28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1r91byx/was_my_modeling_approach_in_this_interview_flawed/)**
*   **Summary:** Users provide feedback and insights to an interviewee who is questioning their data science modeling approach in a recent interview, exploring whether their technical choices were flawed or if other factors, such as communication or interview design, led to the rejection.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is generally **Neutral** and **Analytical**, with elements of **Helpfulness** and slight **Positivity**. Commenters offer constructive criticism and supportive advice, with two comments explicitly rated as Positive, indicating appreciation for the original poster's solid approach while still suggesting areas for improvement.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Interviewers often prioritize understanding the business problem, asking clarifying questions, and discussing assumptions/risks over immediately diving into technical modeling steps.
    *   Specific technical considerations include being cautious about removing features based solely on low variance or high missingness, understanding how models like XGBoost handle missing values natively, and approaching outlier treatment with domain knowledge.
    *   Rejection can stem from various factors beyond technical modeling, such as communication style, reasoning explanation, culture fit, or even a poorly structured interview process itself.

**[Toronto active data science related job openings numbers - pretty discouraging - how is it in your city? (Score: 24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1r8o0n4/toronto_active_data_science_related_job_openings/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses the perceived scarcity of data science job openings in Toronto, with the original poster feeling discouraged, prompting other users to share their observations on the job market's state, the evolving definition of data science roles, and the city's tech industry landscape.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, leaning towards **Neutral** and **Concern**, with one comment expressing **Discouragement** (Negative sentiment) and another offering a slightly more **Positive** outlook on market specialization. Overall, it reflects uncertainty and debate regarding job market conditions.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The data science job market is currently tight and specialized, with fewer pure Data Scientist roles and more emphasis on Data Engineering, Analytics, or production-focused ML roles.
    *   The term "Data Science" has become diluted, making it harder to find specific roles, and companies are now looking for more clearly defined skill sets.
    *   Opinions vary on whether the number of job openings is truly discouraging, with some arguing that the listed numbers might not reflect all available roles or that the field is inherently niche.

**[[Update] How to coach an insular and combative science team (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1r8ray4/update_how_to_coach_an_insular_and_combative/)**
*   **Summary:** An update from a manager describing their actions taken to address issues within an "insular and combative science team," which included layoffs and demotions. This prompted a strong and divided response from the community.
*   **Emotion:** The thread exhibits a **Mixed** emotional tone, with strong opinions ranging from **Skepticism** and **Criticism** to **Support** for decisive management. While some positive sentiment scores exist (e.g., "Kudos for the effort"), a significant portion of the comments questions the narrative's authenticity and the manager's approach.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Some users expressed strong skepticism about the story's authenticity ("fake as story," "Fanfiction?") and questioned how such drastic changes could occur rapidly.
    *   A significant viewpoint criticized the manager's actions, perceiving them as lacking self-awareness, throwing the team "under the bus," and celebrating the demotion/layoff of an entire unit.
    *   Conversely, some commenters supported the decisive action, arguing that sometimes dysfunction requires tough decisions and that clarity and standards are more important than prolonged coaching.

**[Are you doing DS remote or Hybrid or Full-time office ? (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1r8oc7e/are_you_doing_ds_remote_or_hybrid_or_fulltime/)**
*   **Summary:** Data science professionals discuss their current work arrangements (remote, hybrid, or in-office) and the factors influencing their preferences, including compensation, work-life balance, family needs, and professional development.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is **Mixed**, encompassing **Neutral** discussions, **Positive** experiences (especially concerning flexibility), and some **Negative** aspects (like isolation or limited local opportunities). There's a pragmatic approach to weighing the benefits and drawbacks of each work model.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Many express a strong preference for remote work due to its flexibility, which is crucial for managing personal responsibilities, childcare, or avoiding commutes, often requiring significantly higher compensation to consider in-office roles.
    *   Hybrid work is considered an ideal balance by some, offering opportunities for social interaction and in-person collaboration while retaining some flexibility, which can be beneficial for career growth and avoiding isolation.
    *   While some prefer in-office work for better focus or specific career advantages, there's an acknowledgment that fully remote employees might be more vulnerable during layoffs, and local job market limitations can force remote work on some individuals.
