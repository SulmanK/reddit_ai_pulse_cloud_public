# Overall Ranking and Top Discussions
1. [Burning bridges with AI](https://i.redd.it/hciyyqfpahkg1.png) (Score: 46)
    * is that andrew mountbatten-windsor? Did you have to tell it to give ChatGPT a nice ***, or did it do that on its own? Elwood Blues taught me no two bridges are exactly alike... lol There is no bubble popping. Low effort post. Why is everybody the same 3 white people from a family in Indiana Let’s leave all of humanity without work so they can’t afford the products we produce. Capitalism capitalizing itself out of capital. It’s like when brewing beer and the yeast *** themselves in pursuit of growth Photography didn’t *** painting. Humor me, who is the "talent pool" in this metaphor? ChatGPT: Exactly. Burning a bridge means you will not be able to go back, ever. Me: But you just said I didn't need... ***. Burnt the bridge between them and their desperate human slaves. But that is absolutely deliberate.
2. [The Era of the 1-Person Billion Dollar Company Has Begun](https://i.redd.it/de8rqayi9hkg1.png) (Score: 22)
    * why does it say i'll run a billion-dollar app? I used to sell tools for Game Engines. Now you can mimic most tools with a few prompts. If anybody can have a 1 person billion dollar company a d everybody has a 1 person potential billion dollar company, do billion dollar companies even exist anymore? No, it hasn't begun, but the age of stupidity is almost over. I imagine the buttons would be "Continue", "Improve the code", "It doesn't work" and "Don't make mistakes". The fact that there are two gemini watermarks is really funny ahaha me everyday
3. [So apparently today we’re getting Gemini 3.1, DeepSeek V4 and ChatGPT 5.3 (plus “Adult Mode”). Sure we are.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1r8zrra/so_apparently_today_were_getting_gemini_31/) (Score: 16)
    * Unless they plan to lose subscriptions from all the users who actually use the tool for what it’s capable of, they need to release SOMETHING usable fast. I know my subscription expires soon. 5.3 has less chances of lawsuits than adult mode. If other companies release new product, Openai will probably release 5.3 as well. stacked release day. which one are you actually waiting on for a use case? X is notorious for assuming OAI is launching a product every Thursday. There's already evidence Gemini 3.1 is in a few hours. Deepseek 4 could release tomorrow. There’s a chance they may not want to release on the same week as everyone else Apparently leakers are saying Adult mode is releasing today. It’s possible gpt5.3 could be in a separate release but we’ll find out soon enough. Do you guys only use Reddit or you also live life’s in RL? lol these posts and comments “yes I know it’s today”, you guys are like the internet versions of the “the rapture is coming” folks lol. All your insider twitter knowledge I read these posts daily There was a phone update on GPT 5.3, but the text to speech was buggy.

6. [India has released a AI model and It's text to speech Model for Buisnesses.](https://i.redd.it/c16t1i164ikg1.jpeg) (Score: 0)
    * Okay? And? Did the Indian Ai model write this post? The chat + TTS product from Agentix Labs is interesting. They have a few notes on what to look for when wiring TTS into agents here. Probably imported it from China, again /s Ask it how to take a screenshot
7. [Chat GPT is no longer the smartest guy in the room](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1r93pfj/chat_gpt_is_no_longer_the_smartest_guy_in_the_room/) (Score: 0)
    * I switched to Claude a few weeks ago, it's an absolute game changer for actual work. Cancelled my ChatGPT Plus subscription that I had since August 2023 You mean Opus 4.6 and yeah, it's all I use anymore. I knocked out a solid two days of work last Saturday during an olympic hockey game, while paying attention to the game. 2.6? Wow, you went old school, huh? It's great, but the Codex desktop app running Codex 5.3 is also awesome. Try 4.6 Even Google and Gemini AI appear much better in so many areas And it wasn't until I used Claude and Google AI pro until I noticed a GAP! Is open ai/chatgpt concentrating on more agentic operations? Claude is the best chat bot for me right now. I don't see how Open AI will survive. It’s good but sooo expensive.
8. ["We Don't Slow Down"](https://v.redd.it/5x0dmfpamgkg1) (Score: 0)
    * Both AI and humans are creating new things from combinations of existing knowledge and inputs. speed vs safety is the tension. curious where you land on the "ship fast then fix" side. Yeah the problem is exactly in comparing AI to anything that came before, because it's not like anything that came before. A submarine isn't that different from a steam train ultimately, nor from a fighter jet even, compared to how different AI is as a technology. I think he’s right, but we aren’t as concerned about the jobs this technology will take as we should be. Talented musicians can likely just give a better live performance and fill stadiums. Although jobs will dry up for people making a living by playing small venues. We should become fearful when we, as a species, let all the power converge onto a few organisations and individuals, at the expense of ourselves ... The majority of people don't use critical thinking skills to question the answers, so who will be left to ask the tough questions?
9. [Gemini 3.1 Pro Launched - Outperforms 5.3 on many benchmarks](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1r93g0u/gemini_31_pro_launched_outperforms_53_on_many/) (Score: 0)
    * Fake benchmark Most impressive is ARC-AGI 2 at 77% and under $1/task. It'll be very interesting to see what 3.1 flash and 3.1 deep think can do. How many? Many benchmarks or exclusively terminal bench 2 without tools? Misleading title. 5.3 is not out yet and most evals for 5.3-codex are not out yet. For 1 week Yeah, I’m not falling for that one again. I get Gemini for free from work, and I don’t even use it. I’ll try to keep an open mind, but 3.0 for free is worth less to me than paying for GPT and Claude. Seems a little disingenuous to sort of compare it to Codex and claim it out performs 5.3, don’t you think? I think we’re far enough into the cycle now to know that declaring a winner is a fools game. This is just the way things are now till we hit AGI. And probably beyond that tbh.
10. [OpenAI Nears $100 Billion Funding Round. Why These AI Stocks Could Get A Lift.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/openai-nears-100-billion-funding-round-why-these-ai-stocks-could-get-a-lift/) (Score: 0)
