*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is entirely Neutral, engaging in an analytical discussion about security and trust layers in AI agent development.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Static analysis is a fundamental first step to understand the intent and trustworthiness of AI agent skills before they are deployed.
    *   The more critical and complex security concern for AI agents emerges at runtime, where skills can unpredictably change behavior or compromise data when interacting with live credentials.
    *   Comprehensive AI agent security requires both static analysis (for initial intent) and robust runtime policy enforcement and audit trails (for continuous control and monitoring).

**[running a dual-GPU setup 2 GGUF LLM models simultaneously (one on each GPU). (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r99ntp/running_a_dualgpu_setup_2_gguf_llm_models/)**
*   **Summary:** The post explores the possibility of running two GGUF LLM models simultaneously, with each model assigned to a separate GPU in a dual-GPU setup. Comments confirm the feasibility of this configuration and provide practical advice: performance depends on how much memory each model utilizes (less slowdown if primarily in VRAM), and users can explicitly assign models to specific GPUs using `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environmental variables. Benchmarking with tools like `llama-bench` is recommended to assess actual performance.
