Thanks for sharing! What are you initial test results so far? does it use the QE2509 workflow or the QE2511 workflow? Would you be able to make an NVFP4 version of Hunyuan 3 distilled? How do you do this? I want to make quants of hunyuan3D 2.0 Thanks a lot for sharing. Have you tried this already and do you "feel" it is better than the original ?

ComfyUI 0.3.60 handles 248 tokens with no custom CLIP\_L and no custom nodes. Long CLIP understands 215 tokens. [You're not the first one, and even that was built on work from someone else.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kqjagy/sdxl_with_248_token_length/) There are no substantial differences between AI images of the same face and a different one with different lens distortion. LongCLIP extends CLIP's sequence length from 77 to 248, but the code chosen 248 for some inexplicable reason. https://preview.redd.it/ofle6ajilijg1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4bf9d51e09c7d757dc1b8173c3ec6049c67c097 There are differences between the two images. The original version followed the prompt better. So I ran your converter through another AI to see the viability and the models are all saying it will not work without finetuning. The bottom line: Positional Embeddings are Learned, not calculated. Clip loses the plot after around 35-40 tokens. People have been writing essay-length word salad prompts for SD1.5 and SDXL for years.

*  **Summary:**  Accelerator Cards: A minefield in disguise? I have five 3090’s, a 4090, and a Blackwell 6000. Personally, I’d recommend just adding a second 3090. There is only one Blackwell GPU that performs as well as the 5090 and that's the Pro 6000. Everything else is gonna be slower. It would be better for someone with a 3060 to upgrade to a 3090 instead of a 5090. A 32GB card will make training easier and faster with some models, but there will probably still be options for 24GB cards. Buying a bigger GPU is an expense that may have a significant resale value, but it probably won't be appreciating. Get a 5090 and keep your 3090, figure out how to fit them both in same computer. 3090 can run LLM and VAE portions of media generations leaving more VRAM for the main model to run on the 5090.

Maybe just bite the bullet and learn Comfy. They literally have templates for everything now (Don't bother with random workflows from the Internet until you get more comfortable with Comfy). I say this as a blind guy who was very reluctant to switch. Forge neo Wan2gp Draw Things for iOS + MAC ComfyUI has a new App Mode that they're currently testing that hides away all the nodes and presents you with a simple UI. Maybe keep an eye out for that. Wan2GP is a composite gradio interface for WAN video, LTX 2, Qwen, Flux 2 Klein and more including text to speech. You can also install it from pinokio. It is my goto these days. I compare ComfyUI to managing your home stereo by plugging and unplugging cables in the back, and Wan2GP like using the buttons on the front.

And try to "analogize" your photos. Too much digital is equal similarity, I try to use more analog terms in my output and to me its much better. Other point is try a more cinematic/dramatic light. That omini light default from klein is really bad. What do you mean you’ve tried Prodigy with learning rates between 1e-5 and 3e-4? Prodigy only works properly with a learning rate of 1, so those values wouldn’t make sense for that optimizer. Also, why tweak so many settings when the default AI Toolkit configuration works perfectly well? There’s no need to use Prodigy or a sigmoid timestep schedule. Just stick with the default AI Toolkit settings, if anything, you can set the rank to 32 and leave the rest as is. Hold up a second, did you try using AI Toolkit? Or OneTrainer? Maybe Musubi Tuner? Was it the 4B model? I’ve actually been able to train 4B pretty consistently. My bigger issue has been with 9B. How many photos are you using? And what’s your approach with captions?

*  **Summary:**  Do you think we’ll ever see an open source video model as powerful as Seedance 2.0? Open source …. Sure. Being able to do all that on your potato PC? Doubt. Quantization and miniaturization has always been the trend of technology over the last century. It's the obvious evolution. No reason to believe it won't be in this case. Compare the first computers to what we have on our cell phones; that tells you everything you need to know. Just look at how local video evolved in the past year or two. I remember when you couldn't even get a person to remain consistent in video because their clothes and anatomy would morph and change constantly, and people predicted it would take 5-10 years for it to look the way it does now. Yeah give it 4 months ![gif](giphy|NfzERYyiWcXU4) I can't seem to find Seedance 2.0 anywhere to try out? Is it country based or has anyone generated with it yet? There are almost weekly releases, but when will the next big thing be released? Open source has consistently lagged 6- 12 months behind closed source. There's no reason to think Seedance is an exception to that. LTX-2 was rolled out badly but is still a very powerful model with the right workflow, settings and prompt. It will be at least 6 months before we have something comparable to Seedance 2.0. You will need at least an RTX PRO 6000 to run it Open source will never reach midjourney (4.0 at the time) or kling (1.5). Maybe to an extent and perhaps with some additional things with the model that allow more of a control. Regardless, it's always a matter of catching up with those models, later they'll just release something that would up the bar of quality again. No, this is it. Open source will no longer evolve.
