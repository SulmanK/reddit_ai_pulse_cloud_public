# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Is this what ML research is?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ratkiz/d_is_this_what_ml_research_is/) (Score: 80)**
*  **Summary:** Users discussed the current state of ML research, specifically the peer review process, the frustration with demands for large-scale comparisons, and the perception of ML academia becoming overly focused on "engineering competitions" rather than novel ideas. There's an exploration of how authors should navigate reviewer feedback, the importance of polite rebuttals, and strategies for presenting work involving smaller models or resource constraints. There are thousands of papers proposing new things. To help reviewers, you need to evaluate on the currently best method and closest method to your proposed one. You can rent 3090 or A100 for pretty cheap these days. After the rebuttal two reviewers decrease the score. You can disagree with the reviewers, but the whole point is to find an agreement. A diligent reviewer who fully understands your work in a large ML conference like CVPR is basically a shiny pokemon. Being asked for nonsensical comparisons so that low-effort reviewers can simply check that your approach generates bold numbers in a table is very common, yes. I'm afraid this is just how it is. At some point compsci academia became wannabe engineers where everyone is just trying to create *the new software that's x times better than the "competition".* The field has converged on what constitutes a minimally acceptable setup for a given task. In LLM research, one would typically expect experiments at least at the 7B scale. In CNN work, evaluation on ResNets with ImageNet would be more appropriate. You had a 5/3/3, which was above average for cvpr acceptance last year. The fact that two reviewers dropped their scores seems unusual. The new approach requires only 7% of the parameters of state of the art models and is 10x faster at point of inference, while only sacrificing X% in accuracy. As science is a social endeavor, understanding how to engage with the community is a central skill to be learned. ML research should not be an engineering competition. Modern ML research is just engineering. People will tweak one small component of a model or training pipeline to get slightly better results on benchmarks. It's generally more fruitful to leverage connections and publish ML research in applications to a target domain (healthcare , manufacturing z aerospace, etc) within those communities. Which does *** because that means it needs to be more on the applied side by definition, but engagement and traction is generally more healthy in my experience.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with dominant sentiments including **Negative** (3), **Neutral** (3), and **Positive** (4). There is a palpable frustration and cynicism regarding the ML peer review process and the perceived direction of research, but also a strong undercurrent of constructive advice.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   ML research, especially peer review, is often frustratingly focused on benchmark performance and large-scale comparisons, even when these are impractical or irrelevant for a paper's core contribution, leading to a perception of "engineering competition."
    *   Authors must learn to navigate the social and political aspects of publishing, including writing polite rebuttals, contextualizing their contributions (e.g., small-scale models for efficiency), and effectively "selling" their research to the community, regardless of the perceived fairness of the review process.
    *   The field has established expectations for "minimally acceptable setups" for research (e.g., specific model scales or datasets), making it difficult for works outside these norms to gain acceptance without extremely strong, well-articulated justifications.

**[[D] How are you actually using AI in your research workflow these days?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1rabvqq/d_how_are_you_actually_using_ai_in_your_research/) (Score: 23)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around the practical applications of AI tools (like LLMs) in the machine learning research workflow. Users share experiences with AI for tasks such as code generation, visualization, and automating data preprocessing, while also highlighting its limitations, particularly in debugging complex ML code. Question for someone familiar with this benchmark: Does fixing a bug in ML codebases involve running a loop of (fixing data pipeline or training code, run training, run validation, check metrics) ? Or is it closer to SWE tasks but doing it in ML codebases where verifiability is generally much simpler. Claude Opus 4.6 now hits 50% on expert ML tasks like "fix complex bug in ML research codebase". It takes Claude Opus 2 hours to write a model and 1 week to fix it. Ironically, AI does a decent job of highlighting all the problems with the paper this graph is based on. The number of logical bugs in WandB has been reduced by LLMs. I’m using Claude code extensively to simultaneously implement a Python library of RL algorithm implementations in JAX and build experiments using that library. Has been very reliable for me so far with good planning and managing what it is doing. I've been using AI to automate my data preprocessing, which saves me hours each week!
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with dominant sentiments including **Neutral** (3), and **Positive** (3). Users express excitement about efficiency gains from AI in specific tasks, coupled with pragmatic acknowledgment of limitations in complex problem-solving.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   AI tools, particularly LLMs, are highly valuable for accelerating specific parts of the ML research workflow, such as code generation, creating custom data visualizations, and automating routine tasks like data preprocessing.
    *   Current AI models are proficient at writing code but less effective at diagnosing and fixing complex logical bugs within research-level ML codebases, requiring significant human oversight and debugging.
    *   Effective integration of AI into research requires careful planning and management to leverage its strengths while compensating for its weaknesses.

**[[D] Submit to ECCV or opt in for CVPR findings?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ralci0/d_submit_to_eccv_or_opt_in_for_cvpr_findings/) (Score: 17)**
*  **Summary:** This thread explores the strategic decision for ML researchers on whether to submit a paper to ECCV or opt into the new CVPR Findings track. Discussions cover the potential benefits of feedback from Findings, the perceived prestige and impact of this new track versus established conferences, and practical considerations based on paper readiness and author circumstances. Choosing the Findings route allows you to get constructive feedback that can strengthen your research before you submit it fully. It’s a smart way to improve your work and increase your chances of success later on. CVPR Findings will hurt ECCV's business. Some PhD students' papers are not ready yet, but reviews helped to identify fixable flaws. They will improve them and send them to ECCV. Other papers have been submitted before and are no longer improving. They would be a good fit for the findings workshop. I’m on the same boat. Would like to know as well. Prestige-wise Findings papers are naturally somewhere between Main Conference papers and Workshop papers. Largely still solid and sound papers but not exciting enough or with something missing for the main conference. Same boat, but I am leaning towards opting-in. As the other commenter pointed out, it would be a better fit for the findings workshop as this paper has been rejected before. Also, by any chance, do you know how we can "opt-in"? I don't really see a button/form that I need to fill in.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with dominant sentiments including **Neutral** (5), and **Positive** (1). The discussion is characterized by thoughtful deliberation, inquiry, and a pragmatic assessment of options, with a slight underlying concern regarding the uncertainty of a new track's prestige.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The CVPR Findings track can be a beneficial option, especially for papers that need constructive feedback to improve, have been previously rejected, or offer a path to closure for older research projects.
    *   The "prestige" and academic recognition of Findings papers are still evolving and might be less established than main conference papers, potentially causing issues for authors in strict evaluation systems.
    *   The choice between ECCV and CVPR Findings should be a strategic one, based on the paper's current state of maturity, the authors' goals (e.g., seeking feedback vs. immediate publication), and the specific implications for their career or institution.
