    *   Markets are panicking about the impact of AI on various industries. I don't think SaaS will go away completely, but I think the industry will be disrupted by AI in the medium/long term. Yup its dumb panic. Claude Code Security can't do what Cloudflare does lol. AI company made a thing, sell stocks! I’m dumping my zscalar on Monday. Ai only gets better quickly while traditional software dev is too slow. I’m going to put the money into micron or something. I am the biggest Claude fanboy but I have no idea what this does. Cybersecurity is such a broad category of functions and objectives. Like, Is it a firewall? Is it a SIEM? I tried to watch their video, it seems like application securit? that makes up like 6% of all cybersecurity functions. That said, I still love Claude. Then buy the dip and say thanks morons!.

    *   That error usually means the file got GC’d on the backend. Workaround: ask it to zip + base64 the file and decode locally, or have it paste into a gist in chunks; clearing site data and disabling content blockers is still worth a try, but if it’s across browsers it’s probably server-side..

    *   How big are your files? Hasn't happened to me yet. Break the task into smaller pieces and have the agent only read into context the info that is necessary for that task. It helps if the codebase is clearly separated into distinct modules. Sonnet is better than Opus on Claude Code's pro plan. Opus is too small to be useful on the pro plan, so you need to upgrade to it. Opus is NOT made for pro subscription. Ran out in 22 minutes when 4.6 came out before i realised claude code defaulted to opus. Even sonnet on medium effort is a bit hungry. But honestly, on low effort with telling it to save context between sessions it's still better than sonnet 4.5. Break down your repo into easier to digest chunks, break it into phases and write specs. Build a skill that puts guardrails and instructions on how to do it efficiently. "and then the shock came", "in the blink of an eye" hello fellow real person.

    *   Codex does, if you're on Mac. There's also Goose Desktop, I suppose. they're the only Major company to have a desktop app *period*, that I know of. Other excellent desktop apps like MSTY exist, but MSTY is just the app company. Avoid Opus on a Pro plan and you’ll be fine. I wouldn't call it a direct competitor, but I've been playing with Maestro (https://github.com/RunMaestro/Maestro) for a couple days and I think I'm gonna like it. See my recent post elsewhere for comments on running Maestro in coordination with AI Agents like Claude in a container. Do you mean for chat or like an IDE of some sort? The ChatGPT desktop chat experience and the Claude desktop chat experience are nearly identical, other than a cost of paint and the AI “personality”.

*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Users should break down large tasks and codebases into smaller, manageable chunks to efficiently fit within the AI's context window.
    * Opus is considered inefficient for Claude Pro plan users due to small allowance; Sonnet is recommended for learning or economical use, or an upgrade is needed for meaningful Opus usage.
    * Effective use of these AI tools involves minimizing context, building efficient workflows with heuristics or scripting, and implementing guardrails.

*   **Emotion:** Mostly Neutral, with some Positive sentiment.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * More expensive models (Opus/Sonnet) are necessary for complex tasks requiring nuanced understanding, detailed code analysis, or structural redesign, while Haiku suffices for simple queries or initial drafting.
    * Opus significantly improves productivity by requiring less detailed prompting and producing more stable, professional code with fewer bugs.
    * A hybrid workflow is suggested, using Haiku for rough drafting, prompt refining, and execution, and Opus/Sonnet for strategic passes like architecture, refactoring, and diagnosing stubborn issues.
