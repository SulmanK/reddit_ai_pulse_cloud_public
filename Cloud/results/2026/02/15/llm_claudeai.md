**[Claude code burned to all my tokens (I'm on Max) in ~30 mins, twice in a row now, trying to understand why (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1r5oxdh/claude_code_burned_to_all_my_tokens_im_on_max_in/)**
*   **Summary:** A user reports that Claude Code rapidly consumes their tokens, even on the highest usage tier, and seeks an explanation. The discussion identifies multi-agent spawning and over-parallelization of tasks as the main culprits, suggesting sequential processing and clear instructions to Claude to manage token burn.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is entirely neutral, focused on problem-solving and technical explanation. The dominant emotion is analytical.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Claude Code's rapid token consumption is due to its tendency to over-parallelize tasks by spawning multiple subagents, each with its own context window.
    *   These parallel agents independently read and re-read the entire codebase, leading to a much higher token burn than sequential processing.
    *   Strategies to mitigate this include instructing Claude to process tasks sequentially, setting explicit rules in configuration files (like CLAUDE.md), and providing concrete examples for repetitive tasks.

**[The new Claude Code CLI is eating 35GB of RAM and killed my Swap. Memory leak? (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1r5pbnj/the_new_claude_code_cli_is_eating_35gb_of_ram_and/)**
*   **Summary:** A user reports experiencing excessive RAM consumption and swap file exhaustion when using the new Claude Code CLI, suspecting a memory leak. A comment suggests that orphaned child processes, spawned by Claude Code for tool calls that don't terminate cleanly, could be the cause of the high memory usage.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral and investigatory, focusing on diagnosing a technical issue. The dominant emotion is diagnostic.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The new Claude Code CLI exhibits high RAM usage, potentially leading to system instability and swap file exhaustion.

**[Usage limits - Am I doing something wrong? (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1r5pgnd/usage_limits_am_i_doing_something_wrong/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread addresses a user's question about Claude's usage limits, with a comment advising that long conversations consume tokens quickly and suggesting using Sonnet over Opus if sufficient. It also points out that Anthropic (Claude's developer) might have high limits because they perceive their models as superior and recommends exploring other AI providers like Gemini or ChatGPT for tasks not involving code, as they have fewer restrictions.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral, offering practical advice and opinions on AI service providers. The dominant emotion is informative.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Long conversations and using the more powerful Opus model can quickly deplete usage limits.
    *   Anthropic's models are perceived as high-quality, which might explain their usage limits.
    *   For tasks not involving coding, users might find more generous usage limits with other AI providers like Gemini or ChatGPT.

**[Thinking prompt - helps control the drift (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1r5o7hv/thinking_prompt_helps_control_the_drift/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses methods to control "context drift" in multi-agent AI systems. A detailed comment suggests that relying on external state files rather than large system prompts, using handoff summaries between tasks, checkpointing phases, and using short, goal-anchored prompts are more effective strategies. The comment also critiques the original prompt for being too long and containing hallucinated metrics, advocating for less in the prompt and more in external, reloadable files.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral and highly informative, offering detailed technical advice and constructive criticism. The dominant emotion is instructive/analytical.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Context drift in multi-agent AI systems can be effectively managed by externalizing project state into files that the model re-reads, rather than relying solely on the system prompt.
    *   Implementing handoff summaries between tasks and checkpoint files for different phases helps crystallize progress and reduces the need for the model to remember entire plans, thus minimizing drift.
    *   Overly long meta-prompts attempting to control drift can be counterproductive, as they consume context and may contain hallucinated metrics; a more efficient approach is to use short, goal-anchored prompts combined with external state management.
