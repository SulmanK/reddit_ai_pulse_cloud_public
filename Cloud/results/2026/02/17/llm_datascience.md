# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Career advice for new grads or early career data scientists/analysts looking to ride the AI wave (Score: 11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1r7btpj/career_advice_for_new_grads_or_early_career_data/)**
*   **Summary:** Discussions revolved around several key pieces of advice for new data science grads. Suggestions included exploring leadership development programs for broader experience and domain knowledge, emphasizing that hiring managers should focus on a candidate's overall potential rather than just "artifacts of work." Many advised against getting fixated on specific titles, instead advocating for learning the business deeply and being a general problem-solver with data. A strong consensus emerged on the need for rigorous technical skills, particularly in software development or statistics paired with programming, as organizations are maturing and less willing to take risks. Practical projects demonstrating unique insights, architectural understanding, and relevant internships were highlighted as crucial for standing out in a market where basic tutorials are no longer sufficient. Some even suggested considering pure software engineering or specializing in building/fine-tuning foundation models, often requiring a PhD, and mentioned "agentic development" as a future skill.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is predominantly Positive, reflecting a helpful and constructive environment. Many comments offer optimistic guidance and practical strategies. While there are several Neutral comments, they primarily convey factual market realities or specific technical recommendations rather than negativity, contributing to an overall hopeful and informative discussion. The average sentiment score is around 0.59, indicating a generally positive outlook.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   **Acquire a diversified and rigorous skillset:** New graduates should focus on strong software development or robust statistical skills paired with programming. Don't solely rely on generic data science programs or bootcamps, as the market values deep expertise and a capacity for building complex solutions.
    *   **Embrace business context and problem-solving over titles:** Instead of fixating on specific "data scientist" titles, learn the underlying business problems, be adaptable, and demonstrate the ability to apply data skills to solve real-world challenges, even if it means taking on broader analytical or data engineering tasks.
    *   **Build a strong portfolio with practical, unique projects and internships:** Generic tutorials are insufficient. Aspiring data scientists need to show tangible work that demonstrates unique insights, strong architectural understanding, and practical application of skills. Gaining internships is critical for real-world experience.

*   **Summary:** The thread explores the likelihood of re-interviewing at smaller companies or startups after a rejection. Most users agree that policies vary greatly by company, making it a case-by-case situation. Some pointed out that unless a formal account was made, the company might not even remember a previous application. One user shared a negative experience of being denied a re-interview even after 18 months. A key insight was that smaller companies often have the same hiring personnel, who might be psychologically disinclined to admit a "wrong" initial decision, suggesting that a strong, clear introduction detailing improvements since the last application could be beneficial. The consensus was to directly ask the company about their policy.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone of this thread is overwhelmingly Neutral. Comments provide factual observations, personal anecdotes, and practical advice without expressing strong positive or negative feelings. The high average sentiment score (around 0.81) for neutral comments indicates a straightforward, objective discussion about a common job-seeking dilemma.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   **Re-interviewing is company-dependent and highly variable:** There's no universal rule; whether a smaller company allows re-interviews depends entirely on their specific policy, and candidates should inquire directly.
    *   **Smaller companies may have biases due to consistent hiring staff:** With the same individuals often reviewing applications, there might be an inherent psychological barrier to reconsidering a candidate they previously rejected, making re-entry challenging.
    *   **Demonstrating significant improvement can help, but isn't guaranteed:** If reapplying, clearly articulate how your skills and experience have evolved since the previous application, as this might positively influence reviewers who may or may not remember your prior attempt.
