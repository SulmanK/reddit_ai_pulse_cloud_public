**[Are 20-100B models enough for Good Coding? (Score: 8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r6jklq/are_20100b_models_enough_for_good_coding/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the capabilities of 20-100B parameter models for coding tasks, weighing their effectiveness against larger frontier models and hardware requirements. Users share personal experiences with various models like Qwen3 Coder, SEED OSS, GLM-4.7-Flash, and Devstral.
*   **Emotion:** The thread maintains a predominantly Neutral tone, with some Positive sentiment. The conversation is informative, comparative, and opinion-based regarding model performance for coding.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   **Smaller models (20-100B, even 8B or 32B) can be sufficient for good coding**, especially when well-configured, using agentic approaches, and leveraging specific performant models like Qwen3-32B or Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B for web app scaffolding or script drafting.

**[Are there any models that can do reasoning? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r6irir/are_there_any_models_that_can_do_reasoning/)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion delves into whether current LLMs truly "reason" or merely predict tokens, with various perspectives on their capabilities, limitations, and methods to enhance their reasoning-like behavior.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is predominantly Neutral, with a mix of informative, philosophical, and a slightly skeptical perspective.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   **LLMs can exhibit strong reasoning-like behavior**: This is achieved through training, specific prompting techniques (like Chain-of-Thought), tool calls, and dialectical processes. Emergent CoT reasoning is observed in larger models (70B+), and modern techniques enable smaller models to perform well.
    *   **LLMs fundamentally predict tokens and don't "truly" reason**: While they simulate reasoning, their underlying statistical nature means they lack genuine understanding or a programmatic reasoning process, and correctness isn't guaranteed for critical tasks.
    *   **Reasoning capabilities can be enhanced through structured approaches**: This includes using dialectical agents to refine answers, defining process-specific workflows, leveraging synthetic reasoning data, and focusing on improving input questioning during model training.
