Deep down, I hate that - it's how we end up with 'literally' meaning 'figuratively' and similar abominations, but that's how it is.; The difficulty is that there is a gap between the technical definition of AI and the current marketing-driven layperson definition of AI.

HR departments don't check this stuff until you've passed the interview and accepted the offer. You can request a change in your job title when signing the contract.; You could always list your title as Sr. Data Analyst (Machine Learning) or Sr. Data Analyst (Data Science) or something along those lines; There was a time where previous job title mattered.

These days? Not so much.

But, it has always been the case that your salary matters the most when negotiating new salaries.; It doesn't matter. How much are you getting paid and what type of work will you do?; If you want to become a data scientist, negotiate the title. Recruiting for a DS role with analyst title on the resume might be problematic in the future.; Title matters when applying for a job as a data scientist. If the term data scientist isn't in your resume, you might get rejected.; Title does not equal job. Just tell people you're a data scientist; title is fake prestige anyway, especially across companies. scope and money matter more. recruiter noise maybe, but they’ll still call. honestly lucky with how *** hiring is now

This will solve the insular part. Combative is something you fix with regular catch-ups over tea.; this sounds more like an incentive and ownership issue than pure skill. if there are no hard constraints around latency, reliability, or business impact, they can ignore feedback. sometimes things only change when slas and deployment gates are enforced by leadership. without that backing, coaching alone rarely fixes behavior.; *** Id *** to have you on our team :/; If latency, deployment safety, and documentation standards are optional, they will continue to be deprioritized. I would make production constraints explicit and structural, require latency targets, define inference inputs, and clear ownership for sign off.; Clarifying question here - what authority comes(to you) with this ask to up-level this team?; Sometimes you just have to clean house. Especially when dealing with a toxic culture. If you are in charge of these people and they are flat out ignoring you that's completely unacceptable, especially with the lengths you have gone to try to guide them.

It sucks but often you can't cure a toxic culture without a full reset. ; In the end, if you get them to push their code into GIT nightly, the problem is largely mitigated. This isn't about teambuilding, it's about the business owning the property they paid to develop.; If you are a leader, you consult your subordinates when making decisions, but in the end you postulate the correct decision/standard and start prosecuting those not following orders.; At high level there are only a few options: do it yourself to show the example, upskill, hire, or fire. Some people are incompetent but they do not know it. Some lack even the humility to listen to others.; A senior IC is in a quasi-management role and controls jobs, titles and titles.

A replay buffer for rare classes helps.; You have so little data I dont think you should make it more complicated that fresh retains whenever the label space changes.

Work on your imbalance with weighting, focal loss, etc.; retrain periodically, use weighted loss for rare classes. good luck.; i would do periodic full retrains on all human-labeled data, plus a replay buffer or class-balanced sampling for the rare labels, keep a fixed “golden” set for regression checks and track rolling per-class metrics with macro-f1.

If you did undersample, you only need to tweak the intercept term.; With xgboost and similar for binary classification problems, sampling is only necessary if you've got a billion or so observations and/or hundreds of features.; Doesn’t matter what the scaling is if you only care about the predictions. It will move the probabilities around but ultimately the order of your observations from a predicted probability standpoint is not changed. If you actually use probabilities you will need to calibrate with something like betacal or other technique.; It really depends more on what the decision boundary looks like… I would start by doing some plotting and looking at precision and recall for the underrepresented class and go from there.; Model calibration; There are two approaches to solve the problem: resampling and working with the imbalance.; if u under sample, the predicted probabilities won’t reflect the true base rate. the ranking may still work, but calibration will be off unless u correct for the original class prior. using class weights is often cleaner if memory allows.; In my field we deal with less than a 1% bad rate of data sampling. Usually the approach is to build the model on the original data, generate a precision recall curve and choose a probability threshold..

Suggestions range from direct enforcement and making non-compliance visible to stakeholders, to more drastic measures like "cleaning house" if the culture is truly toxic.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, characterized by practical discussions and objective observations. (Average Sentiment Score: 0.67).
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The core issue likely stems from unclear incentives, lack of accountability, and insufficient enforcement of standards (e.g., for latency, documentation, deployment), requiring clear leadership and policy implementation.
    * Direct and firm leadership is needed, potentially involving setting explicit production constraints, requiring adherence, and making consequences clear for non-compliance.
    * Suggestions include 'cleaning house' (firing) if the team is genuinely toxic and resistant, or making their non-compliance visible to stakeholders to drive change.

**[Rescaling logistic regression predictions for under-sampled data?](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1r24okt/rescaling_logistic_regression_predictions_for/) (Score: 13)**
*  **Summary:** This technical thread addresses how to rescale logistic regression predictions when data has been undersampled. Expert advice generally discourages undersampling unless strictly necessary due to resource constraints, favoring class weighting instead. If undersampling is used, calibration of model probabilities is crucial to ensure predictions reflect true base rates. The discussion also covers evaluating models based on practical trade-offs of false positives/negatives.
