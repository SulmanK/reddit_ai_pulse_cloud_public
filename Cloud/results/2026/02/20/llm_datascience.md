# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Does anyone have good recommendations for learning AI/LLM engineering with Typescript? (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1r9hd8e/does_anyone_have_good_recommendations_for/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread focuses on the best strategies for learning AI and LLM engineering, specifically for those interested in using Typescript. The discussion gravitates towards practical, hands-on methods and prioritizing fundamental LLM concepts over the specific syntax of Typescript.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral and constructive. Comments are primarily informative, offering practical guidance and recommendations without strong emotional expressions, reflecting a helpful and objective atmosphere.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Learners should prioritize understanding production LLM patterns, such as evaluations, state management, and controlling model output, as Typescript often functions merely as "glue" in these applications.
    *   The most effective way to learn is by doing: start a project, use AI platforms (like Vercel or Google AI Studio) to generate an initial application, and then reverse-engineer the codebase to understand its design choices.
    *   Utilize AI tools themselves to inquire about and comprehend the rationale behind code decisions, enhancing both Typescript knowledge and overall application workflow understanding.
