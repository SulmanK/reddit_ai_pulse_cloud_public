**[Is Training your own Models useful? (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ra6z5a/is_training_your_own_models_useful/)**
*  **Summary:** The post questions the usefulness of training one's own AI models. Finetuning is useful, but it's not as useful as it was in the past when models were bad in their officially finetuned state. Now you can do it at home or on the cloud. It's easy to do. Training from scratch is very resource intensive (spelled expensive). That’s why most people prefer fine tuning pre-trained models. You can't train LLM at home, it requires a supercomputer. Some complex tasks can't be done consistently using LLMs, which is when finetuning is considered. A user also shared an example of a hydrogen atom model made using a home-trained model.
*  **Emotion:** The tone is entirely neutral, primarily consisting of technical questions and factual statements.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Training LLMs from scratch is generally not feasible for individuals due to immense resource requirements.
    * Finetuning (using pretrained models) is considered useful, especially for specific tasks or when RAG falls short, but its general utility has decreased as instruction-tuned models improve.
    * Guidance is offered on what kind of hardware (e.g., 16GB VRAM for 8B LLM with Unsloth) and tools are needed for finetuning, along with examples of successful home-trained models for specific tasks.

*  **Summary:** The post discusses how AI "memory layers" are promising but still lack temporal reasoning, privacy controls, and deterministic mental models. A user expresses personal conflict and wonders how AI would resolve such issues, suggesting a need for benchmarks. Another user shares an experimental approach using the Evennia MUD framework to anchor information to objects, envisioning a Kanban board-like system for LLM context.
*  **Emotion:** The overall tone is predominantly Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * AI memory layers are a promising concept, but current implementations lack temporal reasoning, adequate privacy controls, and deterministic mental models.
    * Users express personal challenges in how AI might handle complex internal conflicts, suggesting a need for benchmarks in this area.
    * One user shares an experimental approach using a MUD framework (Evennia) to anchor information to objects, envisioning structured knowledge representation for LLMs.
**[HRM for RP guide? (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ra3qmd/hrm_for_rp_guide/)**
*  **Summary:** The post asks about an "HRM for RP guide." A commenter criticizes a related paper, stating that its low parameter count is misleading as it's a purpose-trained expert model for a specific benchmark, not a general LLM. The commenter believes existing architectures are competitive when trained similarly.
*  **Emotion:** The overall tone is predominantly Negative.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * A specific paper (presumably related to 'HRM for RP') is criticized for being misleading.
    * The low parameter count of the model in question is attributed to it being a purpose-trained expert model for a specific benchmark, not a general LLM.
