# Detailed Analysis by Thread

**[[D] A Reviewer Posted 40 Weaknesses and 40 Questions (Score: 70)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1oyce03/d_a_reviewer_posted_40_weaknesses_and_40_questions/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread revolves around a reviewer who gave a paper 40 weaknesses and 40 questions. Many users criticize the review, suggesting it's overly harsh, possibly AI-generated, and focused on irrelevant ablations. Some call for the reviewer to be banned and for the conference (ICLR) to disqualify the review. Concerns about the reviewer's requests for experiments on different hardware setups are also raised.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, though there is underlying frustration and negativity towards the reviewer. Some positive sentiment exists in satirical comments.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The reviewer's feedback is excessive, irrelevant, and potentially AI-generated.
    *   The demands for extensive experimentation on various hardware setups are unreasonable and impractical.
    *   The community should publicly address the issue and request the reviewer's banning or disqualification.

**[[D] Peer Review vs Open Review (Score: 10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1oyp77k/d_peer_review_vs_open_review/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion focuses on the merits and drawbacks of peer review versus open review in the machine learning field. Participants suggest alternative review methods, such as anonymized reviewers with tracked review histories. A specific suggestion is made to create a "Refutations and Critiques" track at ML conferences to address flawed research.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Traditional peer review is flawed and needs improvement.
    *   Open review, or variations with anonymized reviewers with tracked history, could be potential solutions.
    *   A "Refutations and Critiques" track at conferences is necessary to address and correct incorrect research.

**[Beyond Hyperparameters: We're Now Quantifying (and Steering) the Internal Physics of AI Training. [R] (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1oyjt7k/beyond_hyperparameters_were_now_quantifying_and/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses a research paper or project claiming to quantify and steer the internal physics of AI training. Skepticism is expressed in the comments. Some users question the validity of the claims without supporting code, results, or a formal paper.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mostly neutral with some elements of skepticism and positive.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Skepticism towards the presented claims without supporting evidence (code, results, paper).
    *   A request for concrete proof to back up the claims made.
