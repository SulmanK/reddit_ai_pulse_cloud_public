# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[P] I visualized 8,000+ LLM papers using t-SNE — the earliest “LLM-like” one dates back to 2011 (Score: 46)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1owz9g5/p_i_visualized_8000_llm_papers_using_tsne_the/)**
*  **Summary:** The post presents a visualization of over 8,000 LLM-related research papers using t-SNE, highlighting the evolution of the field. Commenters discuss search queries, alternative visualization methods, seminal papers, and the historical context of LLM-like research.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mixed, with a blend of neutral and positive sentiment. Comments range from requests for information to expressions of excitement ("Awesome") and critical assessments of the methodology.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The visualization is an interesting way to represent the landscape of LLM research.
    *   UMAP is a superior dimensionality reduction technique compared to t-SNE.
    *   The concept of "LLM-like" research extends further back in history than the stated starting point.
