**[How do you actually build intuition for choosing hyperparameters for xgboost? (Score: 8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1p3653q/how_do_you_actually_build_intuition_for_choosing/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread is about how to build intuition for choosing hyperparameters for the xgboost model. It suggests hyperparameter tuning and plotting the outputs of each parameter to get a sense of the real range for each parameter. It also suggests that spending a lot of time tuning parameters is seldom a good return on investment.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Hyperparameter tune then plot the outputs of each parameter to get a sense of the real range for each one in your model.
    *   Tweak regularization and balance manually and see what happens.
    *   Spending a lot of time tuning parameters is seldom a good return on investment.

**[Stationarity and Foundation Models (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1p2u2p8/stationarity_and_foundation_models/)**
*  **Summary:**  Stationarity is key for ARIMA and ML models.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Stationarity, means that mean of the residuals is 0 and the variance is constant, which is key for ARIMA and the likes
    *   As with everything else when moving from classical statistics to ML models none of the assumptions you were told to worry about are a problem anymore.
    *   Encode the trend and seasonality via appropriate feature engineering

**[Experience with my recent online assessment. Bait and switch? (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/com/r/datascience/comments/1p3683t/experience_with_my_recent_online_assessment_bait/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread discusses a user's experience with an online assessment that seems misaligned with the job description.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's not data engineering specific but it's general enough data science knowledge that either a) they used a "one size fits all" problem set without reality (disconnect between recruiter and hiring manager) or b) they actually expect everyone in any ds role to know basics of stats and modeling.
    *   They may not really know what they want and you can consider that a red flag for the job. They may list data engineer when they really need a jack of all trades data scientist or a machine learning engineer.
    *   Questioning the level of the position.
