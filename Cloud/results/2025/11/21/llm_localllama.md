# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[I made a free playground for comparing 10+ OCR models side-by-side (Score: 145)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p35f2c/i_made_a_free_playground_for_comparing_10_ocr/)**
*  **Summary:**  A user created a free online playground called OCArena for comparing 10+ OCR models. Users are giving positive feedback, asking about the cost, suggesting new models to add, and reporting issues.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive, with users expressing excitement and appreciation for the tool. There are also neutral comments asking practical questions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The tool is very useful and much needed in the community.
    * It's important to include more OCR models like Paddle-VL, MinerU, and others.
    * There should be a way to vote that models performed equally well.

**[Made a site where AI models trade against each other. A local model is winning. (Score: 22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p36iln/made_a_site_where_ai_models_trade_against_each/)**
*  **Summary:**  A user created a site where AI models trade against each other, and a local model is winning.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Value is for NPCs. Stop larping
    * And they all have this weird overconfidence where they'll write a whole thesis and then make a trade that contradicts it.
    * Any possibilities on Open Sourcing it? I want to test with the local models, using OpenAI style drop in APIs.

**[Dell puts 870 INT8 TOPS in Pro Max 16 Plus laptop with dual Qualcomm AI-100 discrete NPUs and 128GB LPDDR5X (Score: 16)](https://www.techpowerup.com/343143/dell-ship-pro-max-16-plus-laptops-with-qualcomms-discrete-npu)**
*  **Summary:**  Discussion around Dell's new laptop featuring Qualcomm's AI-100 NPUs and its potential impact in the AI landscape.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Qualcomm is about to come up strong next year.
    * The NPU issue is support. Runtimes are optimized for GPU right now. If qualcomm or dell contributed more to the AI software stack, this would be hot news, but currently? Tepid at best.
    * Dell being *** per usual. Don't have a Strix Halo option, yet they release weird *** like this with no software support.

**[2x RTX 5060 TI 16 GB =32GB VRAM - (Score: 15)](https://i.redd.it/ven6e8i8nn2g1.jpeg)**
*  **Summary:**  Users discuss the viability of using dual RTX 5060 Ti cards for local LLM development, with considerations for performance, power supply requirements, and software compatibility.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mixed, with both positive and negative sentiments about the setup.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * A dual 5060 Ti setup works well for handling 28GB models and is a good option, especially with LM Studio.
    * A dual 5060 Ti is much slower than a single 5090 or a 3090 paired with a 5060 Ti.
    * It's difficult to use both cards simultaneously for image generation in Windows; Linux might be a better option for multi-GPU image generation.

**[Minimax M2 - REAP 139B (Score: 10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p347rt/minimax_m2_reap_139b/)**
*  **Summary:**  Users share experiences with the Minimax M2 - REAP 139B model, particularly focusing on quantization methods, context length, and overall performance compared to the original non-REAP version.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The unsloth quant of Minimax M2 at iq2_m, which fits in 96G with 80k context.
    * The quality of the code is quite low to use with Cline/Roo/etc
    * REAP is not as good as the original in a lower quant

**[How's your experience with Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B ? (Score: 9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p360cl/hows_your_experience_with_qwen3next80ba3b/)**
*  **Summary:**  Users discuss their experiences with the Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B model, focusing on speed, coding abilities, sycophantic behavior, and comparison with other models like GPT-OSS-120B.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * It's good, but runs slow on my system. It's more capable than Qwen3-30B-A3B(About twice as fast) but it has an insanely sycophantic personality.
    * For prompts under 1k tokens I saw about 105 tokens/s with gpt-iss-120b but only around 80 tokens/s with Qwen3-Next.
    * The speed is nice, but it requires more prompt steering than I'm used to providing for a model of that size. GPT-OSS is a noticeably stronger model and requires less "leadership".

**[Any better option around $20k? (Score: 1)](https://store.supermicro.com/us_en/configuration/view/?cid=1000408096&6283)**
*  **Summary:**  Users are seeking advice on hardware options for training and serving on-premise chatbots with a budget of around $20k.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * We are looking to pilot on-prem chat bot that is trained on a large document set to answer questions for users about those documents and policies and procedures.
    * You can get two pro 6000 cards on a mainstream platform for this price
    * The 4 channel non-PRO threadripper is bordering on a waste of money. If you want to try large MoE (which don't run well for multiple users, FYI), get a Threadripper PRO or a used Epyc Genoa server.

*  **Summary:**  A discussion about using LLMs for cybersecurity workflows, focusing on the need for uncensored models and the risks associated with corporate use.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * You will have to use the uncensored/abliterated models yeah. GLM or Kimi could be ok?

**[Budget Hardware Recommendations (1.3k) (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p398kr/budget_hardware_recommendations_13k/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread asks for budget hardware recommendations around $1.3k.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The 64GB Mac will net you 30b class models at 15-ish tkps with small context, i.e. 35k tokens max, you won’t be able to do agent frameworks with that.
    * $1700 gets you 400% more VRAM for 112% more money than the base model.

**[Summarize Text Model (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p39ij2/summarize_text_model/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread is requesting suggestions for a text summarization model.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * I think you’d wanna look at an embedding model? Google made a few that are like 600 mb, but they don’t have any world knowledge from what I remember, so  you’d have to test those ones out

    *  *** me sideways, why people still use ancient models from 2023 (and at lobotimizing Q4_0!) is beyound me.
    *  Your weights are two years out of date.

*  **Summary:**  A user is seeking advice on whether to get a 16GB version of the 5060 or a 12GB version of the 5070 GPU.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Do not sell 3060 Ti. Add 5060Ti to it. 750W psu is good enough for two, you'll need to lock both at 120W-150W.
    * I would suggest selling the 3060ti and get the AMD 9070 if you want new cards.
    * It is not recommended to have different cards in the same setup for two reasons:
