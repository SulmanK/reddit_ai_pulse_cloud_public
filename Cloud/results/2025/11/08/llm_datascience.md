**[LLMs vs DSLMs — has anyone shown significant improvements when applying this in companies? (Score: 34)](https://i.redd.it/hp843ng8320g1.jpeg)**
*   **Summary:** This thread explores the debate between using large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific language models (DSLMs) in companies. One viewpoint suggests DSLMs may be outdated due to the rapid updates of generic models, while another argues for the necessity and improved performance of self-hosted DSLMs for specific applications.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral. The sentiment is primarily informative, presenting different perspectives on the application of LLMs and DSLMs.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   DSLMs are becoming obsolete due to the constant updates of generic LLMs.
    *   Self-hosted DSLMs are necessary for throughput and can surpass LLM performance in some cases.
    *   The discussion highlights the practical considerations of choosing between LLMs and DSLMs based on specific business needs.
