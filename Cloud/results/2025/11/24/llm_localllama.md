*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Users are interested in seeing how Fara-7B performs in practice.
    *   There is curiosity about why Microsoft chose Qwen 2.5 VL over Qwen 3 VL for training the model.
    *   A link to a Hugging Face repository of the model is shared.

**[Best Local VLMs - November 2025 (Score: 10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p5retd/best_local_vlms_november_2025/)**
*  **Summary:**  Users are sharing their experiences and recommendations for the best local Vision Language Models (VLMs) in November 2025. Qwen3-vl models are mentioned frequently as performing well.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone of the thread is positive and neutral. Users express excitement about the performance of specific VLMs, particularly the Qwen3-vl variants.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Qwen3-vl models (especially the "thinking" variant) are highly regarded for their ability to read screenshots, extract text, and understand image content, with Qwen3-vl-8b being particularly praised.
    *   minimax-m2 is also recommended for agentic use and coding.
    *   Qwen 3 VL 32B Instruct is liked for rewriting prompts in ComfyUI.

**[32 GB Vram is not enough for Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-AWQ-4bit? (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p5o2yd/32_gb_vram_is_not_enough_for/)**
