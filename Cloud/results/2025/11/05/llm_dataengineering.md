# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] When the pipeline stops being “a pipeline” and becomes “the system” (Score: 115)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oos473/when_the_pipeline_stops_being_a_pipeline_and/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread explores the common scenario where a simple data pipeline evolves into a complex, critical system over time, often accumulating technical debt and becoming difficult to manage.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a mix of positive and negative sentiments expressed by different users, relating to shared experiences and frustrations.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Pipelines often start as quick proofs-of-concept and then become essential systems without proper engineering.
    *   This evolution leads to significant technical debt that is difficult to resolve for future engineers.
    *   The transformation of pipelines into "the system" is a common occurrence in data engineering, especially as businesses rely more on data.
