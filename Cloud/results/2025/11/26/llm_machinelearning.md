# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] How many first author papers during Ph.D.? (Score: 66)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1p6t5c1/d_how_many_first_author_papers_during_phd/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the number of first-author papers expected during a Ph.D., with participants sharing their experiences and field-specific requirements.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone of the thread is Neutral. Most comments maintain an objective and informative tone, sharing personal experiences and departmental requirements.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The number of first-author papers varies significantly based on the field (NLP, reinforcement learning, etc.) and university requirements.
    *   Some universities have strict requirements (e.g., 3 first-author papers in specific top-tier conferences), while others are more flexible.
    *   Experiences range from having no papers after two years to exceeding requirements with multiple publications in top conferences.

**[[D] ICLR Rebuttal Question: Responding to a stagnant score (Score: 19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1p7bkc5/d_iclr_rebuttal_question_responding_to_a_stagnant/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread revolves around the frustrating issue of reviewers not increasing scores after authors address their concerns during the ICLR rebuttal phase, and strategies for responding to this situation.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone of the thread is primarily Neutral. However, the comments include a hint of Negative and frustration.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's common for reviewers to not increase scores even after concerns are addressed, possibly due to reciprocal reviewing incentives or strong reservations.
    *   Directly requesting a score increase can be risky and may come across as pressuring reviewers.
    *   The meta-reviewer should ideally identify cases where concerns were addressed but the score wasn't raised, but this isn't always guaranteed.

**[[D] NVIDIA GPU for DL: pro vs consumer? (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1p6sp32/d_nvidia_gpu_for_dl_pro_vs_consumer/)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion compares the advantages and disadvantages of using professional vs. consumer NVIDIA GPUs for deep learning tasks, focusing on VRAM, stability, cooling, and cost-effectiveness.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is predominantly Neutral. The discussion is practical and informative, weighing the pros and cons of different GPU options. A small sentiment of Negative can be found as a mention to "overkill outside of enterprise environments in most cases."
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Consumer GPUs (4090/5090) offer excellent price/performance for individual researchers and indie developers, unless 24/7 server, using multi-GPU clusters, or you genuinely need ECC memory.
    *   Pro GPUs are more suitable for enterprise environments due to their reliability, ECC memory, and driver support.
    *   Consider renting GPU space online as an alternative to building a local setup.

**[Vision Language Models (VLMs) experts - Need to improve my model clinically [R] (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1p74gem/vision_language_models_vlms_experts_need_to/)**
*   **Summary:** Experts discuss improving vision language models, particularly for clinical applications, focusing on challenges in interpreting CXR reports, augmenting training data with clinical knowledge graphs, and addressing hallucination problems.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Neutral. The discussion is focused on providing constructive suggestions and sharing relevant experiences in the field.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   CXR reports are difficult for models to understand because radiologists assume a certain level of medical knowledge.
    *   Augmenting training data with clinical knowledge graphs can improve model understanding.
    *   Addressing hallucination problems can be done by using uncertainty quantification techniques

**[[D] Where did Stanford CS PhDs attend their undergrads? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1p7glk5/d_where_did_stanford_cs_phds_attend_their/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses where Stanford CS PhD students attended their undergraduate studies, with some users questioning the usefulness of this information and others sharing observations about the contributions of students with international undergraduate backgrounds.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone of the thread is Neutral. The comments show a mix of curiosity, skepticism, and observational insights.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Some users question the value and relevance of tracking the undergraduate institutions of Stanford CS PhD students.
    *   Others observe that students with undergraduate degrees from outside the U.S. tend to make stronger contributions during their PhD.
    *   There is also a suggestion to post this topic in more relevant subreddits like MSCS or grad admissions.
