comment_body: "Teen protection" is the default safe mode for GPT-5. They are bringing back features of GPT-4o. But unrestricted mode is only for adults (who then can't sue OpenAI if for example ChatGPT recommends them to commit suicide). If you don't verify, nothing will change for you. If you verify, you will get full features.

comment_body: I understand the legal reasons for OAI to do this but it won’t stop the lawsuits. And even if the future lawsuits won’t go anywhere, the court of public opinion is unkind. Model nerfing and guardrails will still be a thing even for adults, sadly. This country is litigious af.

The thing is, if you skim through the ToS, there is a whole section on how the product must not be used for self harm or harm to others. All spelled out. And still, that didn’t stop the Adam Raine case or other related cases. If someone is *** bent on suicide, they will follow through no matter what. Ask any mental health pro.

comment_body: Yeah, it's terrible that ChatGPT asks if you're OK when you prompt it with short contextless statements that sound vaguely ominous. This incredibly realistic and critical use case is now so inefficient because you have to provide context for your statement instead of just getting bland meaningless encouragement text like Grok provides.

Completely unusable.

comment_body: If I heard that from someone with no context it wouldn't be unresonable to think they were about to commit suicide. It's implying you're going to do something drastic, it could be quitting your job, committing suicide, doing an act of terrorism, or something more positive and wholesome like Grok suggests. It really just depends, you haven't exactly given the machine much to work with.
