*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the Amazon Applied Scientist I interview process, focusing on the types of questions asked, the importance of leadership principles, and strategic thinking around model selection.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with commenters providing factual information and advice.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Knowing when *not* to use deep learning is crucial.
    *   Understanding and demonstrating Amazon's Leadership Principles is essential.
    *   Practical problem-solving and cost-benefit analysis of algorithms are important.

**[[P] An open-source AI coding agent for legacy code modernization (Score: 0)](https://i.redd.it/h2dp53jfsq2g1.png)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses an open-source AI coding agent for legacy code modernization. A user questioned the way the post was written, claiming it sounded like something cool he just stumbled across, when it’s something he developed. Another user said that it was a great idea.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with a mix of skepticism and support.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The way the post is written is disingenuous.
    *   It’s something you developed, don’t list the features as ‘things that stood out while testing’ and try to make it sound like something cool you just stumbled across.
    *   That is a great idea.

**[[P] Are the peaks and dips predictable? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1p3chd9/p_are_the_peaks_and_dips_predictable/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread explores the predictability of peaks and dips, likely in the context of renewable energy and solar power forecasting. Users suggest various approaches, including weather forecasts, sky-cams, and numerical weather models. The challenges of incorporating domain knowledge are also discussed.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with elements of positivity as users offer helpful advice and resources.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Local weather forecasts are a good starting point.
    *   Numerical weather models, especially with post-processing to estimate sky coverage, are valuable.
    *   Sky-cams and cloud detection from satellite data can improve predictions.

**[[D] Why aren’t there more multimodal large foundation models out there? Especially in AI for science? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1p3k5ac/d_why_arent_there_more_multimodal_large/)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion revolves around the reasons for the limited number of multimodal large foundation models, particularly in the field of AI for science. Cost, data scarcity and quality, and the need for domain-specific expertise are highlighted as major obstacles.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, primarily driven by the analytical nature of the discussion.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The high cost of developing and training these models is a significant deterrent.
    *   The lack of large, high-quality scientific datasets hinders progress.
    *   AI+Science requires domain-specific expertise often lacking in ML practitioners.
