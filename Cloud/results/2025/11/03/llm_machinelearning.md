# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[R] We were wrong about SNNs. The bo.ttleneck isn't binary/sparsity, it's frequency. (Score: 72)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1on7ow7/r_we_were_wrong_about_snns_the_bottleneck_isnt/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread explores the idea that the primary limitation of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) may not be binary or sparsity, but rather frequency-related constraints. It touches on biological neurons and the impact of frequency filtering on the progression of SNNs.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral with touches of positivity, indicating a generally objective and interested discussion.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The bottleneck in SNNs is frequency, not binary/sparsity.
    *   Biological neurons accumulate calcium ions, which have a delayed self-inhibitory effect.
    *   Frequency filtering might explain the slower progression of SNNs compared to ANNs.

**[[R] AAAI 2026 target acceptance rate (Score: 14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1omv5d9/r_aaai_2026_target_acceptance_rate/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread only mentions the Alignment Track and the Social Impact Track.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Consideration of the Alignment Track.
    *   Consideration of the Social Impact Track.

**[[D] Jobs with recommender systems in EU (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ondzi7/d_jobs_with_recommender_systems_in_eu/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread is centered around finding job opportunities in the EU that involve working with recommender systems, with suggestions of specific companies and the role of a PhD in career advancement.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral overall tone, providing informational and practical advice.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Finding jobs in e-commerce companies like Zalando or Allegro is possible.
    *   A PhD is not required but helps with career advancement.
    *   Most people use cloud services; finding a niche is important if you want to do machine learning.

**[[D] RTX 5070 Ti vs 5080 for machine learning (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1on4e8j/d_rtx_5070_ti_vs_5080_for_machine_learning/)**
*   **Summary:**  The thread compares the RTX 5070 Ti and 5080 GPUs for machine learning tasks, focusing on value, performance, and VRAM.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral overall, with a slight tilt towards providing practical advice and comparisons.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The RTX 5070 Ti offers better value for money.
    *   The performance difference between the two cards is negligible for the price increase.
    *   The upcoming RTX 5070 Ti Super with 24GB VRAM may be a better option.
