# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[ Why GCP is so frowned upon? (Score: 49)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1paldet/why_gcp_is_so_frowned_upon/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses perceptions of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in the data engineering space, with comparisons to AWS and Azure. Key topics include market share dominance of AWS and Azure, vendor familiarity, integration with existing Microsoft products, and GCP's strengths in AI. Some users highlight GCP's cost issues and others praised GCP native stack.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with elements of positive sentiment towards GCP from some users, but the main focus is on objective comparisons.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   AWS and Azure dominate the market due to being first movers and having strong enterprise relationships, respectively.
    *   GCP is strong in AI and preferred by smaller tech-focused organizations and those competing with Amazon.
    *   GCP has some drawbacks related to cost, customization, and update frequency compared to competitors.

**[ Google sheets “Database” (Score: 17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1paby5v/google_sheets_database/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread is about asking the community if Google Sheets is a good database. Most of the comments suggest it is not a good idea because it has a hard limit on size, data integrity issues, and other limitations. People recommended using SQLite, Duckdb, motherduck, supabase, airtable, Google Forms, BigQuery, and Apps Script.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Google Sheets should not be used as a database.
    *   If you're already thinking about BigQuery and Apps Script, then you should add each worksheet as an External Table to BigQuery and use Google Forms for data entry.
    *   If you want something better than Google Sheets, then you should use Airtable, SQLite, Duckdb, motherduck, or supabase.

**[ People who feel under market how did you turn it around? (Score: 10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pal6yq/people_who_feel_under_market_how_did_you_turn_it/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread is asking the community about how they turned it around after feeling under market.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with both positive and negative.

    *   The best way to turn it around is to find another job offer and then ask for a match to stay.
    *   Lost my job and I have had two offers at 150% my last salary.
    *   RemindMe in 2 days.

**[ Why did Microsoft *** their Spark on Containers/Kubernetes? (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pao0hv/why_did_microsoft_kill_their_spark_on/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the reasons behind Microsoft's decision to discontinue Spark on Containers/Kubernetes. Possible reasons provided were lack of usage, Microsoft wanting people to use Databricks, and the strategic compete is on Fabric.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Nobody was using it.
    *   Microsoft want people using Databricks shart and Fabric double expensive double shart.
    *   Azure Databricks is a first party service.

**[ From Senior Backend Dev to Data Engineer? (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pa145m/from_senior_backend_dev_to_data_engineer/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the transition from a Senior Backend Developer role to a Data Engineer. Some people suggest it's the perfect transition, while others offer learning resources or point out potential challenges in the current job market without a CS degree.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Build stuff that will teach you the basics of Etl/elt workflows.
    *   That’s the perfect and most ideal transition, find a job for managing data infrastructure, k8s, deploy airflow manage jobs, set up cdcs, and avoid sql data engineer type of data modelling for reporting.
    *   Coming from a software engineering background, you may want to look at spark, dlt and other programming heavy frameworks to build your de skills.

**[ Cost effective DWH solution for SMB with smallish data (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pa4qgk/cost_effective_dwh_solution_for_smb_with_smallish/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses cost-effective data warehousing (DWH) solutions for small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with relatively small datasets (around 600k rows). Solutions provided were duckdb, BigQuery, Python, Pandas, a storage account on azure, or an on-prem SQL server.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral, leaning towards positive as the users provide helpful suggestions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   For small data, a full-fledged cloud DWH might be overkill, so explore simpler solutions like DuckDB or Postgres.
    *   Leverage cloud free tiers like BigQuery's free processing limit.
    *   If you’re already using Power BI Fabric might make the most sense.

**[ What truly keeps data engineers engaged in a community? (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1paca99/what_truly_keeps_data_engineers_engaged_in_a/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread is about what truly keeps data engineers engaged in a community. The difference between good DevRels and those that just want traction and quick wins is that the former produce low-value content or tools that are too salesy. The good ones simply produce valuable content and tools.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The big difference I see between "good" DevRels (and, by extension, the companies they work for) and those that just want traction and quick wins is that the former produce low-value content or tools that are too salesy, with no real depth.
    *   The good ones simply produce very valuable content and tools that are often on the "peripheral" edges of their main focus.
