# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Can you add an unpublished manuscript to PhD application CV? (Score: 46)](https://i.redd.it/jo9hcig0eb4g1.jpeg)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the pros and cons of adding an unpublished manuscript to a PhD application CV. Some suggest putting it on arXiv first, while others advise against including it at all unless it's accessible.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with slight variations.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Putting the manuscript on arXiv is a good way to make it verifiable and less "suspect."
    *   It's better to include it if it's accessible, even if it's just a "working paper."
    *   An unpublished manuscript might be viewed negatively by some hiring committees and could be best to leave out unless you put it on arXiv.

*  **Summary:** The thread seeks guidance on using ML to organize news articles into chains, tackling the challenge of fragmented and contradictory information in modern media.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The problem is related to Narrative Extraction in NLP and can be approached using a survey paper on the topic.
    *   The problem involves clustering text and reconstructing storylines in a fragmented world, requiring techniques beyond simple topic clustering.
    *   A pipeline involving embeddings, pairwise similarity, and nearest-neighbor graphs can be used to build chains from scratch, enforcing linearity with graph constraints.
