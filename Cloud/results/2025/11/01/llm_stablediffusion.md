    *   That's normal depending on a model, this is just how "walking" is conditioned in many cases. Prompt "looking at viewer".
    *   If you tried normal SDXL CNs with Illustrious model, it's not really surprising as they don't mix well in most cases.

**[What the best and most best ai local image generator for 8gb i5 without video memory card (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1olnz5o/what_the_best_and_most_best_ai_local_image/)**

    *   SD 1.5 and it won’t be fast. You’d better pay for cloud services.
    *   SD 1.5 with LCM lora is your best bet.
    *   TBH, don't torture yourself 😅. Just use one of these free or semi-free online generator.

**[Want everyone's opinion: (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1olw5qu/want_everyones_opinion/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread is a general discussion where the author is looking for feedback on their experience with various image generation models like SDXL, Qwen, Wan and Chroma.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mixed, ranging from neutral to positive to negative, as people give all types of feedback and opinions on the various models mentioned.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Flux can do great things with a good prompt.
    *   Depending of the specific model, **SDXL** has much better visuals to me than **Qwen**, but when I ask **Qwen** to give a phone to the character, it gives a phone to the character, not a camera or some technological monstrosity, like **SDXL** does.
    *   Wan 2.2 is the best image generation tool if you have patience.
