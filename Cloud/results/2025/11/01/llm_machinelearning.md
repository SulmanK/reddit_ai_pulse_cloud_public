# Detailed Analysis by Thread

**[[D] ArXiv CS to stop accepting Literature Reviews/Surveys and Position Papers without peer-review. (Score: 293)](https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/10/31/attention-authors-updated-practice-for-review-articles-and-position-papers-in-arxiv-cs-category/)**
*   **Summary:** ArXiv CS is changing its policy to require peer review for literature reviews, surveys, and position papers. This decision has sparked a debate about the integrity of the content, the value of open access, and the potential impact on the community.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mixed, with Neutral, Positive and Negative sentiments expressed. There is discussion on the benefits and drawbacks of the new policy.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The new policy is a much-needed step to preserve the integrity of ArXiv content, especially given the rise of AI-generated papers.
    *   This change undermines the original purpose of ArXiv, which was to provide free and open access to research.
    *   Peer review won't solve the reproducibility crisis, as compute barriers and secrecy around frontier research still exist.
