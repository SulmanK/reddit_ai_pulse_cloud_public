# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Everyone Can ‘Code’ with AI Now, According to Google—But Tech Workers Aren't Fully Convinced (Score: 244)](https://www.interviewquery.com/p/ai-coding-vibe-coding-explained)**
*  **Summary:**  The discussion revolves around Google's claim that AI enables everyone to code and tech workers' skepticism about it. People are sharing their experiences with AI coding tools and discussing whether AI can replace engineers.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   AI may replace junior engineers but not senior engineers, raising concerns about the future development of senior-level talent.
    *   While AI allows more people to "code", it doesn't necessarily equate to creating and shipping quality products, emphasizing the importance of fundamental skills.
    *   AI serves as a tool for developers rather than a replacement, requiring users to possess a foundational understanding of coding principles.

**[ggplotly - A Grammar of Graphics implementation in Python/Plotly (Score: 31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1p9wal3/ggplotly_a_grammar_of_graphics_implementation_in/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion thread is centered around a new Python library called ggplotly, which is a Grammar of Graphics implementation using Plotly. Users are discussing its functionality and potential feature enhancements.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive and neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Users are excited about the implementation of Grammar of Graphics in Python/Plotly, especially those familiar with R's ggplot2.
    *   The library developer plans to add Plotly charts that are not available in ggplot2 over time.
    *   There is interest in understanding what original functionality is not already covered and whether feature completeness is planned.

**[Shap or LGBM gain for feature selection? (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1p9rwhf/shap_or_lgbm_gain_for_feature_selection/)**
*  **Summary:** The main discussion point is whether to use SHAP values or LGBM gain for feature selection in machine learning models. People are sharing different approaches and tools for feature selection.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   SHAP and LGBM gain are fundamentally different, and SHAP may not be the best choice for feature selection.
    *   Using domain knowledge along with techniques like VIF and Chi-Square is recommended for feature selection.
    *   Tools like PerpetualBooster can be used to train a model, check feature importance, and remove low-importance features.
