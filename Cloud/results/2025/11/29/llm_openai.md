*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  ChatGPT's performance and reasoning abilities have declined significantly, especially in coding tasks.

*  **Summary:**  It's normal for companies to bleed money for years before providing a return. Amazon took 9 years to start producing a consistent profit. Open AI will IPO after a big release and rake in plenty of money to float the business.

*  **Summary:**  Dude, there's a lot of actual humans in the top positions of politics and CEOs of major companies that are already like this. Im more worried about their decisions than I am of AI.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  The real ethical issues with AI stem from human decisions in deploying and controlling these systems.
    *  Regulations should focus on accountability, transparency, and the entities controlling AI, rather than the hypothetical consciousness of AI.

**[What happened? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1p9o4z9/what_happened/)**

1:1 aspect ratio. Cinematic. Make him in a holding pose, wielding a dark sword with two hands in front of him, looking down. Preserve all of his details. Cinematic.
