# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] How to deal with product managers (Score: 64)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ovzhy2/how_to_deal_with_product_managers/)**
*  **Summary:**  The discussion focuses on navigating interactions with product managers, particularly when PMs are perceived as overstepping their boundaries or relying too heavily on AI for technical input. Suggestions include defining roles, communicating clearly, escalating issues to leadership when necessary, and emphasizing the data scientist's expertise.
*  **Emotion:** The thread contains a mix of emotions, with a slightly higher leaning towards neutral and positive sentiment. There's a notable presence of negative emotion as well, reflecting frustration with specific PM behaviors.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Define clear roles and responsibilities with the product manager to avoid overlap and micromanagement.
    * When a PM requests a feature, ensure there's a clear understanding of the customer need and validate the request before implementation.
    * Escalate the situation to engineering leadership if a PM is consistently dictating technical implementations.
