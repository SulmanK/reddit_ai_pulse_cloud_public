# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] OpenAI is developing client-side encryption for ChatGPT. But how would this work as the model cannot read the encrypted messages? (Score: 32)](https://i.redd.it/ys3qfb5wf21g1.jpeg)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the technical details of how client-side encryption might be implemented in ChatGPT, considering the model needs to process plaintext. Various suggestions include server-side decryption, encrypted transit and storage, and comparisons to Apple's Private Cloud Compute. The motivation behind this encryption is suggested to be the prevention of fulfilling legal requests for user conversation history.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Client-side encryption could involve decrypting server-side, allowing API access while protecting prompts.
