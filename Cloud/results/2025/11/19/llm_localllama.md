# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[The wildest LLM backdoor I’ve seen yet (Score: 105)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p1grbb/the_wildest_llm_backdoor_ive_seen_yet/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses a potentially significant "backdoor" vulnerability found in LLMs, raising concerns about security and control.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with elements of negativity (due to fear of implications), positivity (due to some people making light of the situation) and neutrality in other comments.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The reported backdoor could allow manipulation of LLMs to bypass censorship and access restricted information.
    *   Some users are skeptical, suggesting the described behavior is just a result of training and fine-tuning.
    *   Focus should be on building security around the LLM, rather than within it.

**[New multilingual + instruction-following reranker from ZeroEntropy! (Score: 34)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1p1iequ/new_multilingual_instructionfollowing_reranker/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread introduces a new multilingual and instruction-following reranker and invites questions.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is generally positive and neutral, with expressions of congratulations, interest, and questions about the reranker's capabilities.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The reranker's multilingual capabilities, especially in code-switched languages like Hinglish, are a key point of interest.
    *   Users are concerned with how well the reranker understands logic and goes beyond simple keyword matching.
    *   There is curiosity about how it compares to other existing rerankers like Cohere 3.5.
