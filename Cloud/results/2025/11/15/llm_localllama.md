*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Connecting the power supplies together with an add2psu adapter and using a standard riser with the 4090 is possible, but it's better to use a powered riser by itself.
    *   A second PSU isn't necessary, just set a 75% power limit when both GPUs are in use.
    *   Powered risers can cause stability issues depending on the quality of the risers.

*  **Summary:** This thread compares the value of M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips for AI tasks.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Macs have very bad prompt processing speed and should use Nvidia for that.
    *   The M3 Ultra makes no sense if you need 256GB or 512GB RAM and if you go for M4 Max then go for the 128GB version.
    *   Wait for the M5 Pro and Max chips to come out as they have significant AI improvements over previous generations.
