**[Unsure about submitting to TMLR[R] (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ot94tv/unsure_about_submitting_to_tmlrr/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread is a discussion about the pros and cons of submitting to the journal TMLR (Transactions on Machine Learning Research) versus more traditional top-tier conferences like ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive to neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   TMLR is a good venue for solid, well-experimented work that may not be as novel or trendy as papers accepted to top conferences.
    *   TMLR has a generally OK review process and high chance of acceptance if you follow the acceptance criteria and claims are backed up by theory and empirical evidence. It may have lower visibility compared to ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, AISTATS, etc.
    *   TMLR reviews are thorough and of good quality, but papers at top conferences often plagued with AI generated and very poor quality reviews.
