# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[ [R] custom Vulkan C++ machine learning library vs TensorFlow (Score: 6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mqgyfe/custom_vulkan_c_machine_learning_library_vs/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around the comparison of a custom Vulkan C++ machine learning library's performance against TensorFlow. Users are offering advice on profiling, optimization, and potential implementation issues.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with users primarily providing technical advice and observations.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Profiling is essential to identify performance bottlenecks before optimizing code.
    *   Vulkan, designed for graphics, may not be the most efficient choice for machine learning compared to specialized backends.
    *   Implementation details, like shared memory usage and memory coalescing, are crucial for performance in CUDA-based convolutions and tensor operations.

**[Problem with dataset for my my physics undergraduate paper. Need advice about potential data leakage. [N] (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mqgcka/problem_with_dataset_for_my_my_physics/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses potential data leakage in a dataset for a physics undergraduate paper, particularly when using synthetic data and photographs. Users offer advice on how to split the data and assess the risk of leakage.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with users offering advice on how to address the data leakage problem.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Splitting data based on pixel distance is not a reliable method to prevent data leakage; manual verification is needed.
    *   A "reasonable" solution involves parameterizing the synthetic data and taking "continuous slices" to move to test/val.
    *   The report should discuss generalisation and robust metrics for evaluating the model.

**[[D] Bethe Hessian Spectral Clustering (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mqur0y/d_bethe_hessian_spectral_clustering/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread explores the reasons behind the limited adoption of Bethe Hessian Spectral Clustering, with users suggesting factors such as lack of awareness and the dominance of Laplacian-based methods.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is predominantly Negative due to the discussion of why a particular method is not widely adopted, although some comments are Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Lack of adoption might be due to the method not working well in practice for many problems.
    *   Adoption is low partly due to lack of awareness.
    *   Limited inclusion in mainstream ML libraries.

**[[D] - Neurips Position paper reviews (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mr7ifp/d_neurips_position_paper_reviews/)**
