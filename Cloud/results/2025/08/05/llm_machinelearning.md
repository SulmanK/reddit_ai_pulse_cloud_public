# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] DeepMind Genie3 architecture speculation (Score: 46)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mic820/deepmind_genie3_architecture_speculation/)**
*   **Summary:** Speculation and discussion around DeepMind's Genie3 architecture, focusing on its emergent consistency, memory management, and video generation techniques. Users are comparing it to existing technologies like NeRFs and Veo3.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Genie3 achieves consistency differently than NeRFs, by generating frame by frame based on world description and user actions.
    *   There are questions about how Genie3 manages memory for storing worlds, and whether frames are small enough for efficient storage.
    *   Genie3 might be similar to Veo3 in terms of consistency, but trained with video and movement input, possibly from video games or simulations.

**[[D] NeurIPS 2025 reviewer Confidential Comment (Score: 11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mie9cz/d_neurips_2025_reviewer_confidential_comment/)**
*   **Summary:** Discussion regarding how to respond to a reviewer's confidential comments for NeurIPS 2025. Users are debating the best course of action, including factual rebuttals and the possibility of making the reviews public.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Focus on factual rebuttals of the review.
    *   Consider requesting public reviews and addressing concerns on social media.
    *   The reviewer might be pointing out the prioritization of gender bias over other dimensions when debiasing.
