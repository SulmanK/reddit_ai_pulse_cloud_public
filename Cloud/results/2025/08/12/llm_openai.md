*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The fight is a pathetic display by the richest people on the planet.
    *   AI model outputs are customized and don't reflect actual truth.
    *   The focus should be on AI acceleration and better models, not social media arguments.

    *   Assume the worst: The increase doesn’t exist until an official spokesperson has said so in two different places.
    *   No, they were thinking about it - which means nothing. They literally announced virtually unlimited Advanced Voice Mode for Plus and it's still the old AVM (or worse) and under an hour.

*  **Summary:** This thread discusses the ChatGPT Mac app and its recent bugs.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 2 Points of View:**
    *   It also randomly makes the contents of the most recent chat vanish. It's a super buggy build that, for some baffling reason, still doesn't let you select "Think Longer" from the available modifiers.
    *   Same issue here. Why not just use the web version instead?

**[[D] GPT 5 doesnt know how a simple trick like dolly zoom works... (Score: 1)](https://i.redd.it/f07qy49nnmif1.png)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses GPT-5 and its understanding of the Dolly Zoom effect.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 1 Points of View:**
    *   Wait, what’s it wrong about? It’s saying that as you zoom in on the focus/object/whatever then behind that focus, the background will appear to swell. If you move out while increasing the FOV, you get the opposite effect where the background appears to expand out vs looming closer. Right?
