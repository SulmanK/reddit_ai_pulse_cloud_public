# Detailed Analysis by Thread

**[[R] Position: The Current AI Conference Model is Unsustainable! (Score: 197)](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mo0ynr)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the unsustainability of the current AI conference model, citing issues such as the carbon footprint of travel, funding limitations for researchers from certain regions, and the perceived pressure to publish low-quality research. Some propose separating publications from conferences, similar to other academic fields.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mixed. While some comments express positive sentiment toward the paper and potential solutions, others express negative sentiment about the state of the field or skepticism about the proposed solutions. Neutral sentiments dominate.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The current AI conference model is unsustainable due to carbon footprint, funding limitations, and a focus on quantity over quality.
    *   A solution is to separate publications from conferences, similar to other academic fields, with journals handling publications and conferences focusing on discussion and networking.
    *   The exponential growth of individual contributions is unsustainable, but projecting trends in this way can be misleading.

**[[N] OpenAI Delivers Gold-medal performance at the 2025 International Olympiad in Informatics (Score: 46)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mnpqu7/n_openai_delivers_goldmedal_performance_at_the/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses OpenAI's gold medal performance at the 2025 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). Some users raise potential criticisms, including the use of scaffolding, ensembles, and the potential for training on similar datasets. Others compare the difficulty of the IOI to other competitive coding platforms.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive, with users expressing excitement about OpenAI's achievement. However, there are also neutral comments that raise critical points about the methodology and comparisons to other competitive coding platforms.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   OpenAI's performance is impressive, but it's important to consider the use of scaffolding, ensembles, and the lack of replicability.
    *   The IOI result is easier compared to leading models.
    *   IMO model generalizes to the extent as LLMs do.

**[[R] AAAI 2026 Reviewer Assignments? (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mnx3vn/r_aaai_2026_reviewer_assignments/)**
