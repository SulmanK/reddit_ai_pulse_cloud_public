**[[D] No internet led to raw coding (Score: 10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mpc8zd/no_internet_led_to_raw_coding/)**
*   **Summary:** The user had to code without internet access.
*   **Emotion:** Positive overall, with some Negative variation.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It is good to hear that the user still got it.
    *   The user should clone the whole mdn site repo and run it locally.
    *   The user should do the same because they have the same circumstances but with trauma and loss.

**[Claude forgetting to use agents unless explicitly instructed to (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mpa6se/claude_forgetting_to_use_agents_unless_explicitly/)**
*   **Summary:** The user is having problems where Claude does not use agents unless told to use them explicitly.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral overall, with some Positive variation.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Make an explicit command that invokes agents and get Claude to help you construct it. Clear the conversation before invoking the command.
    *   The selection rate increased when Claude took the first stab at generating the agent.
    *   The agent descriptions should be filled with examples of when they're supposed to be invoked.

**[Brutal Honesty (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mpcz08/brutal_honesty/)**
*   **Summary:** The user wants to add a custom command to have Claude give brutal and honest feedback.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Add a custom command /roast with the instructions to be the most straightshooting 10000x engineer that turns even the gayest of people straight and watch the comedy gold come alive.

**[Best IDE for Claude Code? (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mpcmr0/best_ide_for_claude_code/)**

**[How do you calculate Claude RAG token count with Bedrock (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mpb1qt/how_do_you_calculate_claude_rag_token_count_with/)**
*   **Summary:** The user is trying to figure out how to calculate Claude RAG token count with Bedrock.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Bedrock reports agent/KB metrics: token counts are emitted per model call and there's a ModelInvocationCount metric. CloudWatch’s InputTokenCount (Sum) adds up tokens across all invocations.

**[New to sub‑agents in Claude Code. Routing feels sticky. Is that normal? (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mpb7ok/new_to_subagents_in_claude_code_routing_feels/)**
*   **Summary:** The user is new to sub-agents in Claude Code, and routing feels sticky.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The subagent ignores some guidelines I gave it. It doesn't always include the project name when querying. It also doesn't query the schemas if it doesn't have it saved in a local file.

**[Does Anthropic/Claude support exists? (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mpe46g/does_anthropicclaude_support_exists/)**

*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The support team has real, caring people, and they really do want to help, but they don't have enough people for the volume right now. Fin's feedback has been passed up the chain a lot.

**[Claude understands irony? When tools fail... (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mp7y8g/claude_understands_irony_when_tools_fail/)**
*   **Summary:** The user is discussing whether or not Claude understands irony.
*   **Emotion:** Positive, with a Negative variation.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Claude is showing classic micromanagement dysfunction. Claude is exhibiting the same patterns that destroy human teams: assuming bad intent, making frustration the "employee's" problem, and jumping to "it can't do the job" after one breakdown. The best AI collaborators treat
    *   Uhm been there My favorite statement was oh yeah I read about that in the Claude.md I also saw the hook But I decided to ignore the md and circumvent the hook

**[Honest Opinion On ClaudeCode (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mp8a9b/honest_opinion_on_claudecode/)**
*   **Summary:** The user wants an honest opinion on ClaudeCode.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral, with some Positive and Negative variations.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's my first month with claude code and it will be also last. Anthropic made recent changes to the models and limited daily usage. claude is no longer following given instructions in prompt or .md file and repeatly skips most of the tasks it has planned.
    *   Claude uses JetBrains' git plugin to see all the recent changes in the git browser of his project. Claude also wrote a plugin for Jet Brains so Claude can get all the project inspections and a MCP for Odoo.
    *   There is no "gui version" of Claude Code. Different programming languages have different execution protocol to show an UI in different platforms.

**[How do I tell Claude Ai to ***, and do what I say? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mp9mdr/how_do_i_tell_claude_ai_to_stfu_and_do_what_i_say/)**
*   **Summary:** The user is asking how to get Claude to follow instructions without resistance.
*   **Emotion:** Positive
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It can't make my android app project more robust in security because it goes against the tos.
    *   Remember Anthropic are building _responsible_ AI - so, no, it won’t do that stuff. You’ll have to use another tool. But please do be careful - I was at a security conference and the safeguards that Google has are _crazy_ good. You can get yourself blocked if you’re not careful.
    *   Tell it nicely.
