# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] GLM 4.5 Air, local setup issues, vllm and llama.cpp (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mpe9p2/glm_45_air_local_setup_issues_vllm_and_llamacpp/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses issues setting up GLM 4.5 Air locally, specifically with vllm and llama.cpp. Users are comparing its performance to the full-precision model and suspect quantization and hidden system prompts are factors.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Quantization is likely the cause of performance differences compared to the full-precision model.
    * The developers might be using a hidden system prompt and chat template, leading to better results.
    * Specifying `--tool-call-parser glm45 --reasoning-parser glm45` for vLLM can help.
