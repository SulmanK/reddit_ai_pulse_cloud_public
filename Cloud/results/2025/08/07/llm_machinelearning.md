# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Have any Bayesian deep learning methods achieved SOTA performance in...anything? (Score: 65)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mjnrmg/d_have_any_bayesian_deep_learning_methods/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread explores whether Bayesian deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in any applications. Users discuss the challenges in training BDL, its potential in uncertainty estimation and learning under distribution shifts, and connections to other models like VAEs and diffusion models. Some suggest BDL's computational intensity makes it lag behind other methods.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is primarily Neutral, with some Positive and Negative sentiments expressed regarding the practicality and effectiveness of BDL.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   BDL excels in uncertainty estimation and learning under distribution shifts.
    *   BDL is computationally intensive and faces training challenges, causing it to lag behind other methods.
    *   Many SOTA models/algorithms can be seen as instances of Bayes' rule, and marginalization, a key aspect of Bayesian DL, is crucial when neural networks are underspecified by the data.

**[[D] Unsaturated Evals before GPT5 (Score: 12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mjtm98/d_unsaturated_evals_before_gpt5/)**
*  **Summary:**  This thread discusses benchmarks that are not yet saturated, specifically in anticipation of GPT-5's release.  Users discuss whether GPT-5 will significantly change the landscape of these unsaturated benchmarks, and one user suggests the Pokeagent challenge remains unsaturated.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral with a hint of Positive sentiment.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   GPT-5 may only make small steps or be affected by data leakage.
    *   The Pokeagent challenge is a good example of an unsaturated benchmark.
    *   A user shows appreciation for compiling the list of unsaturated evals.

**[[D] FP4 training methods (request for paper recommendations) (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mjh0cp/d_fp4_training_methods_request_for_paper/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses FP4 training methods and requests paper recommendations. Users share insights on the use of MXFP4, quantization, and hardware support.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is predominantly Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Recent methods still require a high-precision master copy of weights.
    *   NVIDIA's training may have emulated MXFP4 on FP16 hardware due to H100s lacking MXFP4 support.
    *   FP3 and FP2 may not be feasible as they might need at least 2 bits in the exponent for a float to make sense.

**[[D] Training Whisper Tiny (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mjqcas/d_training_whisper_tiny/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion focuses on the necessities for training Whisper Tiny, including a benchmark dataset tailored for children's speech, baseline metrics, and techniques for isolating noise.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   A benchmark dataset for STT specifically made on children's speech is needed.
    *   Tens to hundreds of hours of audio are necessary for the model to stand out.
    *   Trying other readily available models first on your benchmark is recommended.

**[[D] Idea for an efficient text diffusion model with adaptive, token-level steps (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mjsu50/d_idea_for_an_efficient_text_diffusion_model_with/)**
