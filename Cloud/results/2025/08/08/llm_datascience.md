# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[How do you analyse unbalanced data you get in A/B testing? (Score: 16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1mkdy7a/how_do_you_analyse_unbalanced_data_you_get_in_ab/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses approaches to analyzing unbalanced data encountered in A/B testing. Suggestions include using SMOTE for oversampling, random sampling, avoiding downsampling of the control group, and ensuring random assignment to control and treatment groups to avoid sampling bias. Some suggest looking into pre/post analysis since randomization was not done.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone of the thread is Neutral, with most comments displaying a neutral sentiment.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Address sampling bias by ensuring randomized user assignment.
    *   Avoid downsampling the control group, adjusting sample size calculations for imbalanced sets.
    *   Use SMOTE to oversample the minority class or look up unbalanced design of experiment/bootstrap methods.

**[Resources/tips for someone brand new to model building and deployment in Azure? (Score: 13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1mkzhvp/resourcestips_for_someone_brand_new_to_model/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread seeks guidance for newcomers to model building and deployment on Azure. The responses recommend focusing on key Azure services like Azure ML Studio and Blob Storage, avoiding the complexities of the full Azure menu initially, and using ProjectPro templates for inspiration.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone of the thread is Neutral, with comments exhibiting a positive and supportive sentiment, offering helpful advice and resources.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Start with Azure ML Studio and Blob Storage for simpler workflows.
    *   Ignore most of Azure's menu and focus on essential services.
    *   Use ProjectPro templates for ideas and inspiration.

**[How would you visualize or analyze movements across a categorical grid over time? (Score: 11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1mkmjje/how_would_you_visualize_or_analyze_movements/)**
*  **Summary:**  The discussion revolves around methods for visualizing or analyzing movements across a categorical grid over time. Suggestions range from using Sankey diagrams, heatmaps, animations, and considering a discrete time Markov chain approach if the transition probabilities are time-invariant.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is primarily Neutral, with a touch of positive sentiment, particularly in suggestions like creating "fun animations."
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Consider using a Sankey diagram if the time component is discrete.
    *   If the transition probabilities are time-invariant, use a discrete time Markov chain.
    *   Plot it on a heatmap or create a fun animation.
