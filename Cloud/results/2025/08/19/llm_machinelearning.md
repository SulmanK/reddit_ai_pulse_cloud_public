# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Switching to postdoc in ML for Earth Observation? (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mufrkc/d_switching_to_postdoc_in_ml_for_earth_observation/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread is about someone considering switching to a postdoc in ML for Earth Observation and seeking advice on the field's potential, impact, and career prospects compared to other areas of ML.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Positive, reflecting encouragement and excitement about the Earth Observation field, with a neutral tone in the initial post.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Earth Observation is a smaller but growing field with real-world impact, especially with climate change and satellite data. Skills are transferable to industry.
    *   Focus on interest in the field itself rather than citation count. The field is driven by interpersonal relationships and impactful projects.
    *   The Earth Observation community is adventurous and collaborative, working on solving globally relevant problems.

**[[P] emotional AI might not be science fiction anymore. I accidentally built it, realized it, then patented it. Thoughts ? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1muo312)**
*   **Summary:** The thread revolves around a user claiming to have accidentally built and patented emotional AI, prompting skepticism and requests for evidence or further explanation from other users.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with a focus on questioning the validity of the claim and seeking more information.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The claim is likely an overstatement of existing LLM capabilities.
    *   The user should provide details about the patent application.
    *   The output is likely shaped by the prompt provided to the AI, which isn't a novel accomplishment.
