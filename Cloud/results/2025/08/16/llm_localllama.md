# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] What does it feel like: Cloud LLM vs Local LLM. (Score: 58)](https://i.redd.it/8qtcdau4kfjf1.jpeg)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the differences in experience between using cloud-based LLMs and local LLMs, with users sharing their opinions on performance, hardware requirements, privacy, cost, and future reliability.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with some positive comments about the usability of local LLMs on suitable hardware, and negative comments about their performance compared to cloud-based solutions.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Local LLMs are dependent on hardware but can be "insanely good" with the right setup.
    *   Cloud LLMs may initially seem better but lack long-term reliability and control. Local LLMs offer more control over replacement decisions.
    *   The gap in hardware power between cloud datacenters and local PCs is significant and takes time to overcome, though local models can outperform cloud models if trained on specific datasets.
