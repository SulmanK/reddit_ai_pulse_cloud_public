# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Can we finally agree that creative writing benchmarks like EQBench are totally useless? (Score: 52)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mlsos9/can_we_finally_agree_that_creative_writing/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread debates the value of creative writing benchmarks like EQBench. Some users find them useful for measuring prompt adherence and overall writing quality, while others criticize their subjective nature and the potential for models to overfit to the benchmark's evaluation criteria. There's a discussion on the role of LLMs as judges, the importance of human evaluation, and the need for methodological improvements.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with both positive and negative sentiments expressed. While some users express appreciation and find value in the benchmarks (positive), others express frustration and skepticism about their accuracy and methodology (negative). Neutral comments also discuss the technical aspects of the benchmark.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   EQBench and similar benchmarks are useful for gauging overall writing quality and prompt adherence, even if they have flaws.
    *   The subjective nature of creative writing makes it difficult to create accurate and unbiased benchmarks, especially when using LLMs as evaluators. Human evaluators should be considered despite difficulties to setup.
    *   Benchmarks like EQBench are better than nothing because they offer a large corpus of work to analyze and provide insights, even if the numerical scores should be viewed cautiously.
