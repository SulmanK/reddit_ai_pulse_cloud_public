# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] What AI Engineers do in top companies? (Score: 109)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ml76ip/d_what_ai_engineers_do_in_top_companies/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the roles and responsibilities of AI Engineers in top companies, the required qualifications and skills (often top 0.1% PhDs), and the difference between AI Engineering and ML Research. Some AI engineers are involved in cutting edge research, while others simply glue together helper functions.
*   **Emotion:** Predominantly Neutral, with some hints of Positive sentiment. The overall tone is informative and analytical, with a focus on providing realistic expectations.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   AI Engineers in top companies are often highly skilled researchers with a history of impactful papers, working on designing new architectures and training techniques.
    *   The term "AI Engineering" is broad, encompassing tasks ranging from simple API integrations to advanced ML research.
    *   Many engineers at large companies use AI/ML as part of their jobs but not all write code.

**[[D] How do researchers ACTUALLY write code? (Score: 66)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mln24c/d_how_do_researchers_actually_write_code/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread explores the coding practices of researchers, acknowledging that research code is often messy and poorly documented due to time constraints and the focus on publications rather than production-ready code. It also provides some ways to mitigate the pain of AI development.
*   **Emotion:** Predominantly Neutral, with some Negative sentiment due to the acknowledgement that research code is of low quality.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Research code is often prototype junk, written to just get it to run on the researcher's machine, and rarely checked on other machines.
    *   The primary goal of researchers is publications, not creating well-designed and maintainable code repositories.
    *   There are tools and tricks that can help improve the coding process, such as using einops and debugging on CPU to avoid cryptic cuda error messages.

**[[D] Neurips 2025 being hosted at 3 locations. (Score: 35)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mljnxa/d_neurips_2025_being_hosted_at_3_locations/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the decision to host NeurIPS 2025 in multiple locations (San Diego, Mexico City, Copenhagen) and the possible impact on attendees and the conference experience.
*   **Emotion:** Mixed, with both Positive and Neutral sentiments. Some are happy about the reduced travel and increased accessibility, while others are concerned about the conference being split up.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Splitting the conference into multiple locations is a good idea as it reduces travel and could improve the experience for attendees.
    *   Hosting the conference in multiple locations could help international students and academics with visa issues in the US.
    *   The conference splitting makes sense only if the conference splits into distinct topics for each location.

**[[R] Adaptive Classifiers: Few-Shot Learning with Continuous Adaptation and Dynamic Class Addition (Score: 13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mldqbb/r_adaptive_classifiers_fewshot_learning_with/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses a research paper on Adaptive Classifiers: Few-Shot Learning with Continuous Adaptation and Dynamic Class Addition
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's an interesting application interface over embedding/RAG applied to classification, but misleading to call it "few shot learning"
    *   This is a pretty similar setup to how I walk my students through feature extraction -> unsupervised learning -> transfer learning (we embed then cluster then use transfer learning to classify).
    *   It's a interesting setup, looks good.

**[[D] What happens if reviewers don't fill out the mandatory acknowledgement in NeurIPS 2025? (Score: 11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mltcdn/d_what_happens_if_reviewers_dont_fill_out_the/)**

*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Reviewers have until the 13th of August
    *   If you are an AC, you can click “insufficient review” and flag the review.
    *   For some reviewers, the scores are not visible after the acknowledgment, but for the others, it’s visible (same as the original).

**[[D] Recent AI/ML grad- strong background but getting ghosted. Market Reality Check? (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mlyims/d_recent_aiml_grad_strong_background_but_getting/)**
