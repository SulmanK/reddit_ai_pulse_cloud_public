# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Lightx2v Team relased 8step Lora for Qwen Image just Now. (Score: 89)](https://i.redd.it/3j2396c0q0if1.png)**
*  **Summary:** The Lightx2v team has released an 8-step LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for Qwen Image, a large language model for image generation. Users are sharing their experiences and workflows for using it in Stable Diffusion, noting performance improvements and image quality.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive, with excitement and interest in the new LoRA. There are also neutral comments regarding workflows and technical aspects.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The LoRA provides similar results to higher CFG settings without the LoRA but with significantly faster generation times.
    *   The LoRA works well with the default Qwen workflow and fp8 models, providing good prompt adherence and fast generation on high-end GPUs.
    *   Users are seeking ComfyUI loaders that work with the LoRA and fp8 models, and are sharing their experiences.
