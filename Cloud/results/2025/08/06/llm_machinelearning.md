    *   The discussion focuses on a proposal for State-Based Neural Networks (SBNN) for dynamic computation, with feedback suggesting it's similar to LSTMs, GRUs, and mixture of expert models, and potentially lacking computational savings.

# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Is modern academic published zero-sum? (Score: 126)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1miq2y4/d_is_modern_academic_published_zerosum/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around whether modern academic publishing, especially in machine learning, has become a zero-sum game. Participants debate the impact of high submission rates, the quality of peer review, and the pressure to publish in top-tier conferences.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral. While some comments express frustration, most are analytical and objective. There are slight variations in sentiment, with some negative sentiments related to the peer review process, and some positive sentiments about scientific progress.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The peer review system is flawed due to the high volume of submissions and the inexperience of some reviewers.
    *   Conferences are excessively important, and the culture should shift towards making them places for discussion rather than solely for publication.
    *   Communication and storytelling skills are becoming more important than the quality of the research itself for getting published.

**[[D] GSPO: Qwen3’s sequence-level RLHF method vs. GRPO - stability & scaling analysis (Score: 34)](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mj3t3r)**
*  **Summary:** This thread focuses on a specific method, GSPO, for reinforcement learning fine-tuning and compares it to GRPO. The discussion includes clarifications of the method and some skepticism about results based on a single model.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral. Some comments express doubt and skepticism about the approach while others describe the analysis as "great".
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   GSPO is a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method, not RLHF or RLVR.
    *   GSPO's sequence-level approach is more stable and robust than GRPO's token-level approach.
    *   Results based on a single Qwen model are viewed with skepticism.

**[[D] Do you think LLM memory will ever be solved without fine‑tuning? (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mj3n3v/d_do_you_think_llm_memory_will_ever_be_solved/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread explores the possibility of solving LLM memory limitations without relying on fine-tuning. It discusses various approaches, from bio-inspired NNs to external memory systems, and the limitations of current methods.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral. Most comments are analytical. Some positive sentiments are expressed regarding the topic and the proposed models.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Current LLMs lack inherent memory and require external systems like RAG.
    *   Bio-inspired NNs might offer solutions through multiple overlapping forms of memory.
    *   Memory solutions are needed at the infrastructure level, treating memory as a first-class abstraction.

**[[D] My proposal for State-Based Neural Networks (SBNN): A fine-grained approach to dynamic computation. Thoughts? (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mj3w5c/d_my_proposal_for_statebased_neural_networks_sbnn/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses a proposal for State-Based Neural Networks (SBNN) and receives feedback suggesting similarities to existing methods like LSTMs and GRUs, and potential computational inefficiencies.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral. There is a lack of strong sentiment, with comments primarily focused on technical feedback.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   SBNN is similar to existing architectures like LSTMs, GRUs, and Mixture of Experts models.
    *   Turning off neurons dynamically might not lead to computational savings due to how neurons are processed in arrays.
    *   Despite not being a novel concept, it's a worthwhile area to explore and read more about.
