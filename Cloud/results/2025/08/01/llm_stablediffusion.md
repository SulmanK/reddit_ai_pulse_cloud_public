*  **Summary:** if you are a little technical i'd use tailscale. it creates a vpn tunnel to your home network, so you can connect to the port that comfyUI runs on, 8188 usually. you dont have to expose any ports or anything like that on your router. just install on your phone and on your PC at home.

*  **Summary:** Make sure you aren't accidentally selecting a T2V instead of an I2V model for either half of the generation process. Lowering the resolution, frame count, or number of LoRAs you load could free some VRAM.

*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Post your workflow to see what is wrong
