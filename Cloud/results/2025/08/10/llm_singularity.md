*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the new GPT models (GPT-4o, GPT-5-Thinking) and their capabilities. There is speculation about potential limitations or catches associated with increased usage. Users also express desires for easier integration of these models into coding environments.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a mix of anticipation, curiosity, and slight skepticism regarding the new models. Some positive sentiment is present, expressing excitement and appreciation for the advancements.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   GPT-5 represents a significant jump in capabilities.
    *   There are concerns about potential limitations or hidden costs associated with the increased usage of GPT-5.

**[Each day only *7%* of plus users were using reasoning models before? So people really were just subscribed for 4o, fascinating. (Score: 113)](https://i.redd.it/jsl3afrpo8if1.jpeg)**
*   **Summary:**  The thread focuses on the surprising statistic that only a small percentage of ChatGPT Plus users were actively using reasoning models prior to GPT-5. People were primarily subscribed to 4o. Discussion revolves around the reasons behind this, including a lack of awareness, the router, the prioritization of speed over reasoning for certain tasks, and users simply preferring 4o.
*   **Emotion:** The overall tone is neutral and inquisitive. There is a fascination with the low usage of reasoning models, and users are pondering the possible explanations.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The low usage of reasoning models is due to a lack of user awareness about how to access them.
    *   Many users subscribed to ChatGPT Plus primarily for GPT-4o and did not require the reasoning capabilities of other models.
    *   The automatic router of GPT-5 may change user behavior and increase the use of reasoning models.
