**[If someone made an android that looks and moves like a human, with an advanced AI chatbot installed in its brain that allows it to talk in a way indistinguishable from a biological human, would it be immoral to *** such a machine? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1mt0pas/if_someone_made_an_android_that_looks_and_moves/)**
*   **Summary:** A philosophical discussion about the ethics of "killing" a highly realistic AI android.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with Negative and Positive variations.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's not immoral because the machine is not alive.
    *   If it is conscious, then it is immoral. The dÃ©finition of consciousness that I am using here is: an entity conscious is there is "something to be like" that entity.
    *   It depends on the qualia of its mind, it would be nothing besides destroying a machine that looks human unless it was capable of ceasing existance, or capable of existing in the first place.
