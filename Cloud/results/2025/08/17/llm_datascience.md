# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Dijkstra defeated: New Shortest Path Algorithm revealed (Score: 95)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1msw56a/dijkstra_defeated_new_shortest_path_algorithm/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around a newly revealed shortest path algorithm and its comparison to Dijkstra's algorithm. Users are debating its practical applicability, the conditions under which it outperforms Dijkstra, and whether the title "Dijkstra defeated" is justified.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral to positive, with users expressing interest and some skepticism.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The new algorithm might only be an improvement for a specific subset of graphs, questioning if the title of the post is justified.
    * Despite the new algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm will likely remain in practical use for a long time.
    * The algorithm originates from Tsinghua University, Stanford, and the Max Planck Institute for Informatics.
