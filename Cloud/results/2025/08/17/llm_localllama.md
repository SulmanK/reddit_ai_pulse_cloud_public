# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] MoE optimization idea (VRAM/RAM) (Score: 12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1msyzh8/moe_optimization_idea_vramram/)**
*  **Summary:**  Discussing an idea for optimizing Mixture of Experts (MoE) models in local setups, specifically concerning VRAM and RAM usage. The conversation revolves around the potential overhead of switching between experts and how to efficiently manage expert usage to improve performance.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Switching between experts can introduce latency that outweighs the benefits.
    * MoE models should be trained to evenly distribute load between experts.
    *  A calibration run on a small dataset to create a task-specific profile would be beneficial.

**[Why does Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 Q8_0 work on my machine and no others come close? (Score: 11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1msy01r/why_does_qwen330ba3binstruct2507_q8_0_work_on_my/)**
*  **Summary:** Users are comparing the Qwen3 model's performance to other models, particularly focusing on why it runs well on the poster's machine. The discussion explores the impact of active parameters, RAM usage, and the use of Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Qwen3-30B-A3B works well because it only has 3B active parameters, making it less resource-intensive.
    * The A3B part has 3B active params. Some other models should be able to run up to 8B active params at Q4
    * Qwen3-30B-A3B is a MoE model, making it like running a smaller model.

**[What happened to the Uncensored models like Dolphin? (Score: 8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1msvs0i/what_happened_to_the_uncensored_models_like/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses the availability and frequency of uncensored models like Dolphin. Users share insights on current releases, potential reasons for a perceived slowdown, and alternative models.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Uncensored models like Dolphin are still being released.
    * The rate of release has slowed down due to increased training costs.
    * There are many uncensored models being released every month.

**[Qwen3-30B-A3B and quantization. (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mt070m/qwen330ba3b_and_quantization/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion is about different forms of quantization.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Not all floating point variants should be rounded to just "FP".

**[OSS20B is actually good? (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1msyqr3)**
*  **Summary:** Users discuss their experiences with the OSS20B model, its performance, and how it compares to other models. Some users share example outputs and discuss different settings for optimal performance.
*  **Emotion:** Negative
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * OSS20B does well in limited testing, especially with high reasoning effort.
    * One user reported that it takes hours to respond and gets stuck in a thinking loop.
    * Using bigger models with no thinking is faster and more precise.

**[Ranking the Chinese Open Model Builders (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mswah3/ranking_the_chinese_open_model_builders/)**

**[Did anyone figure out some working way to get some model inferenced via OpenWebUI with ollama to get to browse or search internet like ChatGPT does? (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mswdmu/did_anyone_figure_out_some_working_way_to_get/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion focuses on integrating internet browsing and search capabilities into local LLMs via OpenWebUI and Ollama, similar to ChatGPT. Users are looking for working solutions and sharing insights on prompt engineering and tool usage.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * There is no known way for OpenWebUI to browse or search the internet like ChatGPT.
    * The model needs to be defined in the prompt. It needs to provide the current system time, cutoff-date, location and criteria for when to use the "web\_search" tool.

**[Vendor-Agnostic UI Comparisons (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1msz8we/vendoragnostic_ui_comparisons/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around comparisons of vendor-agnostic UIs for local LLMs. Users share their experiences with different UIs, highlighting setup difficulties, responsiveness, and available features.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * One user is asking why the OP is asking.
    * One user tried OWUI (too much setup), librechat (weird method of Openrouter setup), anythingllm and Jan (not very responsive UI on Linux), and gpt4all (loved it but local rag embedding is slow and no tool support).

**[Analysis of (vacation) picture collections w/ local LLM (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1msvqnh/analysis_of_vacation_picture_collections_w_local/)**
*  **Summary:** Users are trying to find a way of analysing picture collections with local LLMs.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Multiple models can take input of many images. Mistral 3.2 24B and Gemma3 multimodal modals seem to take an arbitrary number of images. My bash script is to take frames from a video and ask the bot if something is happening across the frames.

**[Why even if my local llm provide correct tool call response but not actually calls the tool, I get just json (Score: 0)](https://i.redd.it/xutuj6lwyljf1.png)**
*  **Summary:** Users are discussing why they get json responses instead of actual tool calls.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Qwen takes tool calls in XML and not JSON I believe.
    * You need to parse the response and perform the tool call.

**[I used free API from open router. As a reply to the first message ever, I think I got someone else's answer or model hallucinates really bad! (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mswc1l)**
*  **Summary:** Users are getting weird replies from the model.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * I guess that's what you get with an API model...? This is LocalLlama, not APILlama :)
