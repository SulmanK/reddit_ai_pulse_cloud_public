**[Why do the same OpenSource Models on OpenRouter perform very differently depending on the provider that's hosting them? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mnnflv/why_do_the_same_opensource_models_on_openrouter/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread asks why open source models have different performance characteristics on different providers.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Quants, wrong templates, different sampling parameters/order/samplers like DRY, and that's all before we even go into the stochastic nature of the models that will happily pass a benchmark today, only to fail it completly tomorrow.
    *   The providers specify the average t/s and quantisation they provide.
