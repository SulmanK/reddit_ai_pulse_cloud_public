**[Is Databricks the new world? Have a confusion (Score: 37)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mn6ctn/is_databricks_the_new_world_have_a_confusion/)**
*  **Summary:** Databricks offers significant power, but it depends on your specific use case. Just knowing Databricks without Data Engineering principles won't make you a good data engineer, it's a good 'everything' platform with orchestration, ingestion, a catalog, managed postgres, open table formats and AI.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotion is Neutral, though some comments exhibit Positive sentiment towards Databricks.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Databricks is a powerful platform, but its value depends on the use case and scale.
    *   Knowing Databricks alone doesn't make one a good data engineer; fundamentals are crucial.
    *   Databricks is a convenient "everything" platform that simplifies data engineering workflows.

**[What are the use cases of sequential primary keys? (Score: 36)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mnaure/what_are_the_use_cases_of_sequential_primary_keys/)**
*  **Summary:** Sequential keys have the advantage of query speed when joining in a non-distributed database. They are also simpler and more reliable and useful in big data contexts.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotion is Neutral, with some Positive sentiment regarding specific use cases.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Sequential keys offer query speed advantages, especially in non-distributed databases.
    *   They are simpler and more reliable compared to other key types.
    *   They are useful in write-heavy systems and for audit trails.

**[dbt common pitfalls (Score: 23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mnfvae/dbt_common_pitfalls/)**
*  **Summary:** Biggest pitfall is letting every man and his dog develop models with no consistency. Tight devops processes, style guidelines, naming conventions, etc. are some things mentioned in the thread.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotion is Neutral, with some comments expressing a Negative sentiment related to mistakes.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Lack of consistency in model development is a major pitfall.
    *   Treating dbt like a script runner instead of embracing modularity is a mistake.
    *   Poor devops practices and lack of version control are common issues.

**[AI tool that extracts data from any document? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mnecff/ai_tool_that_extracts_data_from_any_document/)**
*  **Summary:** In the next year, all the "big beasts" in the data space are going to "eat your lunch". Snowflake already does this (effectively out of the box) and I'm sure every other data platform can either already do this or is planning to release this
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotion is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It doesn't handle invoices with subtables in the line items very well.
    *   All the "big beasts" in the data space are going to "eat your lunch" in the next year.

**[Healthcare Legacy Nightmare (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mng4vx/healthcare_legacy_nightmare/)**
*  **Summary:** Research and hands-on data analysis works for me. The old-school (pre-xml) edict and x12 are format-wise simple. The X12 standards are a little harder to find. Boomi training is a 5-tran.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotion is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Quit the job.
    *   Research and hands-on data analysis works.
