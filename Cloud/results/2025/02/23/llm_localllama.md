# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Grok's think mode leaks system prompt (Score: 3478)](https://i.redd.it/xcbb7ou4ewke1.jpeg)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion centers around a leaked system prompt for Grok's "think mode," raising concerns about censorship, the trustworthiness of the AI, and the true intentions of "free speech absolutists."  Some users defend Grok while others point out that this is easily replicable.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, although negative emotions appear regarding censorship and Grok's trustworthiness, with scattered positive comments.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Grok's "free speech" stance is hypocritical, and it's actually pushing a specific agenda.
    *   The leaked prompt is evidence that Grok cannot be trusted and is instructed to lie.
    *   The leak is being downplayed or dismissed as fake news, but it's easily verifiable.

**[96GB modded RTX 4090 for $4.5k (Score: 157)](https://i.redd.it/5rf8m3k1rxke1.jpeg)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses the existence and feasibility of a modified RTX 4090 with 96GB of memory being sold for $4,500. Users question the possibility of such a modification, the credibility of the seller, and the implications for NVIDIA's market strategy.
*  **Emotion:** Predominantly Neutral, with tones of curiosity and skepticism.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The existence of a 96GB modded RTX 4090 is questionable, and the seller is likely not credible.
    *   Modifying the RTX 4090 to have 96GB of memory is technically feasible, but details on how it's achieved are unclear.
    *   NVIDIA is prioritizing profits over accessibility, leading to the emergence of modified cards to address the demand for high VRAM solutions.

**[[R] Unlocking Long-Context LLM Inference on Consumer GPUs with HeadInfer (Million-level Tokens) (Score: 39)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iwfs2z/r_unlocking_longcontext_llm_inference_on_consumer/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread discusses a new research paper presenting HeadInfer, a technique for enabling long-context LLM inference on consumer GPUs. The discussion includes comparisons to other methods, questions about memory requirements, and performance analysis.
*  **Emotion:** Largely Neutral, with some positive sentiment expressed towards sharing the research.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   HeadInfer's performance (6 tok/sec at 20k context) is not impressive compared to standard inference, questioning its practicality.
    *   There's interest in how HeadInfer compares to other long-context methods like KVCache.
    *   The method requires substantial RAM (1TB), which is a potential barrier for many consumers.
