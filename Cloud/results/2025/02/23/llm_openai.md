    *   For me, image generation is directly in Chat for me. For the scripts, I haven't generated anything like that. That's not how it should work.
    *   Do you mean even when GPT-4o is selected, sometimes it enters reasoning mode even when not asked for?
    *   Click the highlighted INFO button for explanation of what each model does. The GUI and models are one of the best in the business for simplicity and ease of use. No issue getting stuff done on my side.
    *   Maybe select the model that is the best performing? Research the product you are purchasing a little bit they have different models
    *   There is no need for a reasoning model in the free tier. You can still create an image from the front page screen as before.
