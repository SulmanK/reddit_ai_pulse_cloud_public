*   **Emotion:** Primarily neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   There are some general tips for increasing inference speed. Inference is RAM bound for K quants and IQ4. More CPU power is needed for IQ3 to IQ1.
    *   I thought the ollama default was 2k as mentioned in their FAQ, [https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-can-i-specify-the-context-window-size](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-can-i-specify-the-context-window-size)
    *   Are you comparing apples to apples? First you mention quantizing the model, which you can do with llama.cpp but not with Ollama. Second, are you running the same quant of qwen2.5-7b on both llama.cpp and Ollama? Ollama is pulling qwen2.5-7b\_q4\_0 are you using the same quant on llama.cpp?

**[Could a BitTorrent-style P2P network for AI inference actually work? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1itemdz/could_a_bittorrentstyle_p2p_network_for_ai/)**
*   **Summary:** Explores the feasibility of using a BitTorrent-style P2P network for AI inference, discussing potential challenges and alternatives.
*   **Emotion:** Primarily neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The P2P network would contain clusters that runs the deepseek large model. Each node would need to have enough vram and be able to run the full model.
    *   It might work in a swarm intelligence mode where nodes join together to explore a problem.
    *   This pops up a lot.. yes it's possible but it would be unusable slow due to network overhead. So no real utility other than academic an "we got it working" brag.
