# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[What areas does synthetic data generation has usecases? (Score: 45)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1igo4dh/what_areas_does_synthetic_data_generation_has/)**
*  **Summary:**  This thread is about the various areas where synthetic data generation is useful, particularly where data is private, expensive, or difficult to acquire. Use cases like inverse problems, finance, medicine, and transportation were discussed.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone of the thread is neutral, with most of the comments focused on objective explanations of use cases for synthetic data generation. There is one comment with a positive tone regarding medicine, showing a slight variation.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Synthetic data is useful for inverse problems where you model a process and work backwards.
    *   Synthetic data helps generate larger training sets by injecting noise for models that struggle with real-world data.
    *   Synthetic data can be used to protect sensitive information by generating data with similar distributions, such as for medical records.
