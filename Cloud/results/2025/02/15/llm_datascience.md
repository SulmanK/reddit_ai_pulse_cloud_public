# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Data Science is losing its soul (Score: 400)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1iq0gwj/data_science_is_losing_its_soul/)**
*  **Summary:**  The discussion centers around the idea that the field of data science is shifting away from its core principles, with increased emphasis on quick, low-risk projects and the potentially detrimental impact of relying too heavily on automated machine learning pipelines and large language models (LLMs).
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral. Some comments express concerns about the direction of the field, while others offer counterarguments and suggestions for maintaining quality and integrity in data science work. However, most comments are fact-based, so they have a neutral score.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Data Science is losing its focus on rigorous methodology and offline evaluation, being replaced by AutoML and LLM workflows applied to biased datasets. This carries the risk of product failures and outsourcing of DS teams.
    *   Data Science teams are responsible for maintaining quality. They should establish benchmarks, use business rules when data is insufficient, and communicate truthfully about business needs and potential improvements.
    *   The pursuit of immediate wins and low-hanging fruit is a valid business strategy, especially for companies new to machine learning. These quick wins build trust and can be enhanced later based on ROI.
