*   **Summary:** A user shares a tool they built that filters ArXiv papers using an LLM judge and seeks feedback. Other users express interest and ask about trying it out.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Positive, with users expressing excitement and interest in the tool.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The tool looks really cool and addresses a need.
    *   The creator built the tool after considering a similar idea a few days ago.
    *   One user questioned what they were supposed to do since the post was just a screenshot.

**[[D] Is my company missing out by avoiding deep learning? (Score: 13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iq9gtk/d_is_my_company_missing_out_by_avoiding_deep/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses whether a company is missing out by avoiding deep learning, with varied opinions depending on the company's specific needs and industry. Some argue that deep learning is essential for certain tasks, while others suggest hybrid approaches or traditional methods may be sufficient.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with some Positive sentiment about the potential of hybrid systems.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It depends on the domain and whether the company can tolerate unexplainable errors.
    *   Hybrid systems combining DL and traditional methods are likely better.
    *   The decision depends on what processes the company is modeling and whether current approaches are failing.

**[[R] Evaluating Physical Concept Understanding in LLMs Through Abstract Grid-Based Tasks (Score: 8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ipw78p/r_evaluating_physical_concept_understanding_in/)**
*   **Summary:** A user expresses interest in a paper evaluating physical concept understanding in LLMs, highlighting the importance of understanding how LLMs perceive the world.

**[[D] Have any LLM papers predicted a token in the middle rather than the next token? (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iq4f0r/d_have_any_llm_papers_predicted_a_token_in_the/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses LLM papers that focus on predicting tokens in the middle of a sequence, rather than just the next token. Examples like BERT, T5, DeepSeek V3, and the concept of "Fill In the Middle" (FIM) are mentioned.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with users providing informative responses and examples.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   BERT uses masked language modeling to predict masked tokens in the middle.
    *   T5 uses a pre-training objective of predicting a span of tokens in the middle of a text.
    *   DeepSeek V3 trained their model on Fill In the Middle (FIM) tasks.

**[Unpaired modalities[D] [R] (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ipql8c/unpaired_modalitiesd_r/)**

*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with users sharing relevant information and expressing interest in the topic.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   CyCLIP and ULIP use cycle-consistency and contrastive learning for unpaired training.
    *   Multi-MAE uses a depth network to imagine the depth of ImageNet images.
    *   Some users suggest just building unimodal models if alignment isn't important.

*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with some Positive sentiment for a desktop
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Might have better luck on /r/stablediffusion.
    *   Laptops are a poor choice for running ML models.

**[[D] [R] DeepSeek-R1 on Microsoft Azure just wrote this Azure AD exploit on its own (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ipmt0a/d_r_deepseekr1_on_microsoft_azure_just_wrote_this/)**
*   **Summary:** The poster claims that DeepSeek-R1 on Microsoft Azure wrote an Azure AD exploit on its own. Other users are skeptical, suggesting it might be a hallucination or just public information.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with skepticism towards the claim.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The exploit is likely a hallucination.
    *   A llm should not be allowed to give you any public information.
    *   Unless the exploit actually works, this is just the model writing "hackeverything=true" and you making a schizopost about it that may also be AI generated.
