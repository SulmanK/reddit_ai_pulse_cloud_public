# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Figure 02 humanoids sorting mail at a customer facility (Score: 136)](https://v.redd.it/up98y2vc6jle1)**
*  **Summary:**  Discussion about a video showing humanoid robots sorting mail, with comments ranging from skepticism about the practicality and cost-effectiveness of such robots to excitement about the potential for general-purpose robots.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral. While some comments express excitement, most are analytical and objective. A single negative comment is present as well.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  Humanoid robots are not yet practical or cost-effective for complex tasks like mail sorting.
    *  The video demonstrates the potential of general-purpose robots to replace human workers in various scenarios.
    *  Mail sorting has already been automated, so the demonstration is not particularly impressive.
