# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] GPT4.5 API Pricing. (Score: 86)](https://i.redd.it/vvklfed8pqle1.png)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses the pricing of the new GPT4.5 API. Users express concern and disbelief about the high cost, questioning whether the performance justifies the price. There's speculation that it might be GPT-5 underperforming, and that the API is expensive as *** due to being a multi TRILLION parameter model.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is **Neutral**, with sentiments of disbelief, concern, and some negativity due to the high pricing. Some comments show slight frustration and disappointment.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The GPT4.5 API pricing is too high for the provided capabilities.
    *   The model might be an underperforming GPT-5 rebranded.
    *   The pricing indicates a massive model size (multi-trillion parameters).

**[I've compiled some of GPT4.5 "Vibes based testing" from X users. (Score: 65)](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1izpeea)**
*  **Summary:**  A compilation of user experiences and tests with GPT4.5, particularly focusing on its "vibes-based" performance. Some found it to be huge with crazy expensive API. It is bad at technical translations, but managed to get the meaning of a pun in one of text samples that no other model has gotten before. It might be better at coding that Claude and still get lower bench marks if it can translate intent better.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is mixed. A lot of neutral, but some are **Positive**.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   GPT4.5 is being tested for "vibes-based" performance, moving away from pure benchmark gaming.
    *   The model is huge and the API is crazy expensive.
    *   GPT-6 is on the way.

**[If you missed the 4.5 demo… (Score: 20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1izpsgb/if_you_missed_the_45_demo/)**
*  **Summary:**  Reactions to the GPT-4.5 demo. Many felt that the model did not live up to the hype and that Sam was to blame for the high expectations. Some users found it to be a decent upgrade. Some thought the product presentation was the worst they have ever seen.
*  **Emotion:** Mixed emotions, ranging from **Positive**, **Negative**, to **Neutral**, with an overall sentiment that the demo was underwhelming.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The GPT-4.5 demo failed to meet high expectations.
    *   Sam Altman is to blame for over-hyping the demo and creating unrealistic expectations
    *   It is a decent upgrade.

*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Multi TRILLION parameter model bigger than the original gpt-4 and more expensive than o1

**[It is better at some things, but not relevant for the Singularity. Let me be disappointed guys. (Score: 14)](https://i.redd.it/qcs8v23vtqle1.png)**
*  **Summary:**  Expressing disappointment with GPT-4.5, especially regarding its relevance to the singularity.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is **Neutral**.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Having a better world knowledge, world model and lower hallucination rate should help with the next generation of reasoning models after o3.

**[GPT 4.5 API pricing is crazy (Score: 12)](https://i.redd.it/w8vn06lutqle1.jpeg)**

*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is **Neutral**.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   This feels more like an experiment to test how much they can scale pretraining and whether it provides significant gains... clearly it didn't. maybe bad training run? i think the parameters for this model is like 2-5 trillion.
    *   This is just ChatGPT 4 with a bigger pre-training that utterly failed to achieve significant gains. They will distill the f out of 4.5 to make it cheaper, the hallucination rate will go up, and we will be back to a slightly better 4o which don’t forget is a distilled version of 4

    *   Need to show some positive cash flow to investors.
    *   It either costs them a dozen-hundred times less and this is some temporary margin (is it worth it for someone?!! We will see)
    *   Or >10x efficiency over GPT4 is wrong

*  **Summary:** Expressing concerns about the pricing of GPT-4.5
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is **Neutral**.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The improvements in the GPT-4.5 are limited and the prices make mass-marketing impossible for the time being. It was the Orion project that prompted OpenAI to reveal the project.

**[GPT 4.5 (Score: 8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1izq182/gpt_45/)**
*  **Summary:** Discussing how GPT 4.5 model did not live up to the hype.
*  **Emotion:** Mostly **Negative**, with elements of disappointment and skepticism. Some **Positive** comments about Gary Marcus being right.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   This is a wake up call for people in this sub who were posting hype comments about ASI in 2025 or 2026.
    *   GPT5 better be really great.  They are certainly losing on pricing front lately.
    *   Scaling is dead.

**[Claude 3.7 Sonnet scores less than DeepSeek R1 on ARC-AGI (Score: 7)](https://i.redd.it/h6k730srpqle1.jpeg)**
*  **Summary:** Comparing the performance of Claude 3.7 Sonnet and DeepSeek R1 on the ARC-AGI benchmark.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is **Neutral**.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   You can train a 100 m parameter model to perform better than o3. It just means they didn't train for this benchmark. ARC-AGI isn't meant to determine whether something is AGI, it's one of many examples of something that is trivial for humans.
    *   Comparing reasoners to reasoners, 8k thinking tokens is beating R1. Not sure how many “thinking tokens” are typically used by R1 though
    *   The non thinking model is slightly worse than the thinking model? Isn't this good? Normally the thinking model is decently better than the regular one, but in this case sonnet 3.7 is close to deepseek's thinking model.

**[Pleasantly Surprised by GPT4.5 (Score: 6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1izpjp4/pleasantly_surprised_by_gpt45/)**
*  **Summary:** Expressing positive surprise and excitement about the new enhanced ability to explain things.
*  **Emotion:** Predominantly **Positive**, with some users expressing excitement and anticipation to try the model.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's like more intuitively smarter which is awesome when you just want to talk to it and get an instantly useful response.
    *   Lower Hallucination rates will be huge over time as 4.5 is used more and more across the world.
    *   High performance for a base model.

*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It may be that there is a wall at Sonet or 4.5, but o3, R1 and others are already on the other side of the wall.
    *   we have to wait till gpt5 to make any assumptions
    *   Claude 3.7 is apparently much worse for writing. It's pretty much meant for coding only. I would wait for reviews to come in first.
