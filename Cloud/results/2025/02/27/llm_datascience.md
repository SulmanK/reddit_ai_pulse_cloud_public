# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] DS is becoming AI standardized junk (Score: 116)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1izmkfd/ds_is_becoming_ai_standardized_junk/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses concerns about the data science field becoming overly standardized and reliant on AI, potentially leading to a decline in critical thinking and problem-solving skills. There are complaints about the hiring process, pre-written EDA scripts, and take-home assignments.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with moments of positivity regarding being cool. The thread also shows frustration and concern about the state of the data science field and the job application process.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The data science field is becoming too standardized, relying heavily on AI and pre-written solutions, reducing the need for critical thinking and expertise.
    *   The current hiring process, especially the use of take-home assignments for a large number of applicants, is inefficient and disrespectful of candidates' time.
    *   There is a growing disconnect between the skills companies say they want (critical thinking) and what they actually value in the hiring process and on the job.

**[I would rather do anything except work on my thesis. Do all researchers feel like this? (Score: 33)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1izfg97/i_would_rather_do_anything_except_work_on_my/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread revolves around the common feeling of aversion towards working on a thesis, with commenters sharing their experiences and offering advice on how to overcome this hurdle. It discusses potential burnout, the differences between academia and industry, and strategies for managing time and motivation.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral to positive, with many offering words of encouragement and relatable experiences.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Feeling aversion towards thesis work is normal, and many researchers experience this.
    *   Burnout may be a significant factor, and taking a break or addressing the root causes of the feelings is important.
    *   The experience of working on a thesis is different from working in the industry, and the skills learned in academia, such as time management and project completion, are valuable.
