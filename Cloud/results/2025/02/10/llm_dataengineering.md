# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Big shifts in the data world in 2025 (Score: 106)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1im7dak/big_shifts_in_the_data_world_in_2025/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses predicted shifts in the data engineering world for 2025, including unified data stacks and AI agents. Many users express skepticism about the feasibility and practicality of these trends, especially regarding AI's ability to accurately interpret and manage data models. Concerns are raised about vendor lock-in, the complexity of implementing unified platforms, and the potential for these trends to be driven by venture capitalist interests.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a hint of skepticism. While there are positive sentiments related to the potential of AI and unified stacks, the dominant feeling is one of cautious assessment and doubt.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Skepticism about the feasibility of AI accurately interpreting data models and generating correct SQL.
    *   Concerns about vendor lock-in and the overstatement of difficulties associated with using multiple tools.
    *   A call for simpler solutions like PostgresSQL+Python+Kubernetes/Airflow.

**[When is duckdb and iceberg enough? (Score: 42)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1im5kgl/when_is_duckdb_and_iceberg_enough/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread explores the use cases and limitations of DuckDB and Iceberg. It discusses the performance of DuckDB on smaller datasets, its use in development and testing environments, and its limitations in scalability.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive, although there are some negative sentiment scores.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   DuckDB and Iceberg are suitable for medium workloads.
    *   DuckDB is meant to be used for single user.
    *   DuckDB iceberg support is quite poor.

**[Is snowflake + dbt + dragster the way to go? (Score: 26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1im6qx1/is_snowflake_dbt_dragster_the_way_to_go/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the suitability of Snowflake, dbt, and Dagster as a data engineering stack, considering factors like cost, scalability, and ease of use. Some suggest alternatives like SQLMesh or simpler solutions like Snowflake cron for basic needs. The discussion covers various aspects, including the amount of data, setup time, cost sensitivity, and current/future use cases.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a mix of positive and neutral sentiments. Users generally provide balanced perspectives.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Snowflake, dbt, and Dragster are a fantastic stack if you want to start quick.
