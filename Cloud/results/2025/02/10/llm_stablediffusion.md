**[How can I make the extra (padded) area mirrored to the original? So that it's not grey, and I can denoise on lower amounts other than 1. (I tried Image Flip and Crop, but it's too messy for such a simple task.) (Score: 2)](https://i.redd.it/jespv5bsucie1.jpeg)**
*   **Summary:** Users are discussing how to seamlessly mirror the padded areas of an image using Stable Diffusion, touching on techniques like outpainting, fill and photobashing.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
