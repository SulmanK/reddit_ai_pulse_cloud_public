**[Medium Blog post on EDA (Score: 21)](https://medium.com/@joshamayo7/a-visual-guide-to-exploratory-data-analysis-eda-with-python-5581c3106485)**
*  **Summary:**  The discussion centers around a Medium blog post on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The main point of contention revolves around the article's advice on normality testing and data transformations. Critics argue that many common techniques don't assume a particular distribution for observed variables and that testing for normality can be bad practice.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with both positive and negative sentiment.  Some express support and pride, while others critique the article's advice. Overall sentiment is negative.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Some statistical techniques do not assume any particular distribution.
    *   Explicitly testing for normality is bad practice.
    *   The advice given in the article on normality and outliers is flawed.
