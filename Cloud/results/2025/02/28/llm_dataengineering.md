# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[What are the biggest problems in our field today? (Score: 9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1j0elsz/what_are_the_biggest_problems_in_our_field_today/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses the main challenges in the data engineering field. It highlights issues such as the lack of domain knowledge among data engineers, the impracticality of LeetCode-style interviews, the overwhelming number of tools and technologies to learn, marketing exaggerating tool capabilities, the lack of standardization in tooling, and the difficulty in defining specialized roles within data engineering.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is predominantly neutral, reflecting informative and objective commentary on the state of the field. A slight negative sentiment is noticeable due to the problems being discussed.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The lack of domain knowledge is a significant hurdle for data engineers.
    *   The current interview process is flawed, with an over-reliance on LeetCode-style questions.
    *   The sheer number of tools and the aggressive marketing of new technologies create confusion and hinder progress.

**[Self healing Data (ETL) pipelines! Does it exists already or could be a very good choice for MSc research project? (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1j04guo/self_healing_data_etl_pipelines_does_it_exists/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread explores the concept of "self-healing" data pipelines, questioning if they exist and their feasibility as an MSc research project. It touches on the use of ML for filling missing values, anomaly detection, and error recovery, with skepticism about modifying authoritative data with non-authoritative values.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mainly neutral and inquisitive, but there's also some skepticism and caution regarding the implementation of self-healing mechanisms, particularly the use of ML to fill missing values.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Using machine learning to fill missing values in data could compromise data integrity.
    *   Anomaly detection should be performed separately from ETL pipelines.
