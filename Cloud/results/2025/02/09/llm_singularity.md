# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[ [D] AchievedüéØ | Teleportation before GTA 6‚ÄºÔ∏è (Score: 447)](https://i.redd.it/ar0z1d9ms5ie1.jpeg)**
*   **Summary:** The post highlights a breakthrough in quantum teleportation of logical gates across a network link, achieved by creating interactions between distant quantum systems, potentially paving the way for a future 'quantum internet.'
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with comments ranging from technical explanations to skepticism and humor.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Quantum teleportation has been achieved across a network link, marking a significant advancement.
    *   The claim of "teleportation" is misleading, as it actually involves quantum entanglement and doesn't transfer information.
    *   This achievement could lay the groundwork for a future 'quantum internet' and distributed quantum computing.

**[If a general strike isn‚Äôt organized soon it may never be possible again. (Score: 188)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ilht0o/if_a_general_strike_isnt_organized_soon_it_may/)**
