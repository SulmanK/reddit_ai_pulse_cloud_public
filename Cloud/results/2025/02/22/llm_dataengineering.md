    *   First, you figure out what the stored procedure is doing. Then, you do those same things in Python using libraries that can query the database with the same queries, and transform the resultant data however the sproc does.
    *   Use deepseek or Claude and convert the sql to Python. Then review the results.
    *   If the schema is the same, read the s3 data in Athena and convert the SQL to athena syntax.
