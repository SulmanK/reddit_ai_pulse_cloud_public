**[What is it called when an LLM model doesn’t remember the initial conversation? (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1inza0t/what_is_it_called_when_an_llm_model_doesnt/)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion revolves around the phenomenon of LLMs "forgetting" earlier parts of a conversation. The main points include context window limitations and possible solutions to extend the LLM's memory.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The phenomenon is called the context window, which refers to the limited amount of text an LLM can understand at once.
    *   Using models with larger context windows, like Qwen2.5, can help mitigate this issue.
    *   Quantization can affect the model's ability to retain information.
