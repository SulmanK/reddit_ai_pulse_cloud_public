# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[OC] There's far better ways to work with larger sets of data... and there's also more fun ways to overheat your computer than a massive Excel book. (Score: 52)](https://i.redd.it/n2s5thveoqje1.png)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses alternative tools for working with large datasets instead of using Excel.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mostly Neutral, with some positive sentiment expressed.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Excel is memory efficient but not always the right tool.
    *   Excel is fine for data exploration but not for actual data analysis; suggesting using Sqlite and Python instead.
    *   SQL and proper databases are better.

**[ROC vs PRC - Not what I expected (Score: 38)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1irkor6/roc_vs_prc_not_what_i_expected/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses ROC vs PRC.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mostly Neutral, with some positive sentiment expressed.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Some users are not familiar with PRC.
    *   Using knowledge of ROC vs PRC is a good way to weed out unserious candidates.
    *   It might be considered ChatGpt abuse if someone did not know the subject.

**[What app making framework do you recommend to data scientists? (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1irs5de/what_app_making_framework_do_you_recommend_to/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread is about recommendations for app-making frameworks for data scientists.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mostly Neutral, with some positive and negative sentiment expressed.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Use existing data visualization tools if available.
    *   Streamlit is recommended for under 100 users, and Dash is recommended for larger applications.
    *   RShiny for async/multithreaded/long running tasks is bad.

**[Dataflow Diagrams and Other Planning? (Score: 6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ir3o2h/dataflow_diagrams_and_other_planning/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the usefulness of Dataflow Diagrams and other planning in data science projects.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Dataflow diagrams are helpful for early alignment and reducing future issues.

**[Weekly Entering & Transitioning - Thread 17 Feb, 2025 - 24 Feb, 2025 (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1irc50e/weekly_entering_transitioning_thread_17_feb_2025/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread is a weekly discussion for people entering or transitioning into the field of data science, with users asking for career advice.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   A person with 10+ years of experience in demand forecasting, predictive modeling, and analytics is looking to transition from a data-heavy operations role in D2C retail into a more data science-focused role.
    *   An international student is looking for a job as a data scientist in the US, but the market for DS graduates is very difficult. Trump's immigration policy makes hiring H1B holders harder for employers. He also wants to study robotics in the EU.

**[How to actually apply Inferential Statistics on analyses/to help business? (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1irr33g/how_to_actually_apply_inferential_statistics_on/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses how to apply inferential statistics in business analysis.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Inferential statistics allows you to study a sample and make generalizations about the sampled population. To be successful in the role of data analyst, you need some general business acumen or other subject matter expertise.
    *   with millions of users, I imagine your bread and butter will be conducting/analyzing A/B tests â€” would be a good starting point for exploration.

**[Leverage my skills (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1irlf7b/leverage_my_skills/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread is about leveraging skills in data science.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with some positive sentiment expressed.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   You need four essential skills in DS: Descriptive analytics, Statistical inference, Machine learning, and Casual inference. Your skills will probably allow you to dabble in descriptive analytics only.
    *   Unless you want to be a statistician, you should focus more on ML skills.
    *   Interview Query offers guides and peer mock interviews where you can practice real-world data science scenarios. LeetCode offers algorithm practice and Pandas and Scikit-learn explore the basics of data analysis.
