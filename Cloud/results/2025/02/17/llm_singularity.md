    * AGI can't be compared to things like the industrial revolution, as it's unique: it will be the first time humans will be (almost?) completely obsolete. Therefore, your arguments don't really apply here.
    * AI replacing jobs is probably a good thing. The worry is once it reaches super-intelligence.

    * Should have posted this a bit earlier since this was published on the 14th of this month.
    * Read between the lines and then ask the question.

    * Midjourney still occupies a niche, but they won't be able to compete with the big names in 2-3 years.
    * They have started to develop hardware.

**[Kimi surpases DeepSeek (Score: 29)](https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/kimi-k1-5-language-model-5c420eac5766)**
*  **Summary:** Discussion on whether Kimi has surpassed DeepSeek with some asking for verification.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Interesting. Well, let independent analysts analyse Kimi and put it on a comparative list of models alongside the others. Until then, I won't believe anything.
    * I am primarily interested in fiction writing. To me Deepseek, Claude and ChatGPT are the best. Kimi feels like another run of the mill Qwen like model - smart, safe, boring.
    * Kimi is utter garbage and has never been of any use.

**[Jeff Dean & Noam Shazeer – 25 years at Google: from PageRank to AGI (Score: 17)](https://youtu.be/v0gjI__RyCY?si=KG_Bm_81R1YrtrmR)**

    * This was a great interview, but also not that groundbreaking. I enjoyed it, though, and deepened my understanding of things.

**[What would happen if all decisions of a company are made by AI? (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1irey4t/what_would_happen_if_all_decisions_of_a_company/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread explores the idea of a company being run solely by AI and the potential outcomes.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * This would call into question the fundamental matter of private property.
    * The company would fail in a matter of hours. AI have a limited working memory.
    * A future AGI system will probably own and manage the means of production.

**[Which Technology will Delfine the next decade? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1irh39c/which_technology_will_delfine_the_next_decade/)**
