*  **Summary:**  This thread discusses the choice between SATA and NVMe for LLM development hardware.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  NVME drives with on board DRAM are the best choice for development systems.
    *   Spinning rust is great for archival.
    *   For inference, faster storage is only useful for loading the model into video or system memory which only needs to happen once.

**[Pure Front end for OpenAI backend? (no extra backend needed) (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ipip36/pure_front_end_for_openai_backend_no_extra/)**
*  **Summary:**  This thread asks for a pure front end for OpenAI backend that does not need any extra backend.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Openwebui is very backend-heavy.
    *   If you want something really lightweight, you could try a CLI client for openai-compatible APIs, such as parrotflume.
    *   The reason these "frontends" have a backend is because they must manage everything needed to support an inference engine.
