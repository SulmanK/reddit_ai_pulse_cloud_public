# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[ [D] AI isn’t evolving, it’s stagnating (Score: 371)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1iun6jy/ai_isnt_evolving_its_stagnating/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the perception that AI development, particularly in LLMs, is stagnating due to the overemphasis on language models at the expense of other AI approaches, and the focus on profitable applications rather than fundamental advancements.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is mostly neutral, though some comments express positivity about the future of AI, and others express negativity about current AI practices.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * LLMs are overhyped and other forms of ML are being neglected.
    * AI progress is fragmented and lacks a unified vision, driven more by business interests than scientific advancement.
    * AI is still relevant and the rise of LLMs can accelerate progress in other areas of AI.

**[To the avid fans of R, I respect your fight for it but honestly curious what keeps you motivated? (Score: 93)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1iuw9ow/to_the_avid_fans_of_r_i_respect_your_fight_for_it/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread explores the reasons why some data scientists still prefer using the R programming language over Python, citing its strengths in statistical modeling, visualization, and a welcoming community.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is largely positive.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * R is better suited for statistical modeling and visualization, especially with packages like tidyverse.
    * The R community is welcoming and engaging.
    * R is preferable because users don't have time to learn Python.

**[Uncensored DeepSeek-R1 by Perplexity AI (Score: 31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1iuib2z/uncensored_deepseekr1_by_perplexity_ai/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the "uncensored" DeepSeek-R1 model by Perplexity AI, with comparisons to the original Chinese version and concerns about potential biases.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is generally neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The DeepSeek-R1 model is actually more censored than the Chinese DeepSeek.
    * LLMs are in an endless cycle of retraining the same data.
    * The R1 wasn't censored to begin with, but there is an additional model for censoring input when you call the model in China.

**[How Would You Clean & Categorize Job Titles at Scale? (Score: 10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1iuivf9/how_would_you_clean_categorize_job_titles_at_scale/)**
