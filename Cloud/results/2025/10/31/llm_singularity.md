comment_body: The problem with anything we think we understand is that we think that because of our current paradigm. For example FTL travel could very well be possible. It just might transcend our understanding of reality. Like you can travel faster than light, but it shifts your entire reality to another dimension, which is why we haven’t seen it in ours. We just assume we know why something would or wouldn’t be possible without ever fully understanding the reason why anything is the way it is. But I’m just a brain dead gooner, so just my .02

They are only hurting themselves. They are not on the level of Youtube and Audible in monopoly yet which is the point where consumers have a very hard time leaving despite the product getting worse.

Hello, wake up? when a startup is made, the founders want to make money and exploit a new trend in the market, sooner or later they will sell to Big Corp.
When? as soon as they are profitable and the occasion present herself at the door.
