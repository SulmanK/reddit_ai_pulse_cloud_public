*   **Summary:** The thread is asking the user how to give AI tools context.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   To solve the context, give each instance( directory) its own memories to manage. This can scale unlimited. It's a highly customizable setup and not complex.
    *   force the AI to study X part of your code, such as a system, feature, function, class or whatever you might need to implement later on. Then ask it to do so.
    *   Easy quick way is to ask it how something works first, then ask it to plan the change.
