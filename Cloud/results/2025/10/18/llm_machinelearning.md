# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[P] Open-Source Implementation of "Agentic Context Engineering" Paper - Agents that improve by learning from their own execution feedback (Score: 16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o9yuxv/p_opensource_implementation_of_agentic_context/)**
*  **Summary:**  Discussing an open-source implementation of a paper on "Agentic Context Engineering," where agents improve by learning from their execution feedback.  The lack of a central place to find new papers is also mentioned.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is negative, potentially stemming from the difficulty in discovering new research papers and the challenges in current model design.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The disappearance of paperswithcode has made it harder to find interesting new papers.
    *   Many researchers are independently converging on similar solutions involving MoE or agent clouds with a supervisor.
    *   The fundamental issue lies in using context as memory with large contexts, which requires a fundamental change in model design rather than brute-force approaches.

**[[D] NeurIPS 2025 schedule (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o9xx4s/d_neurips_2025_schedule/)**
*  **Summary:** A query if the NeurIPS 2025 schedule has been announced.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is negative, due to the simple fact that the answer is "No, it's not announced yet."
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The NeurIPS 2025 schedule has not been announced yet.
