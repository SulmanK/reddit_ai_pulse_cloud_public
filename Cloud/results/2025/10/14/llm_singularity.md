    *   Political neutrality in 2025 means sounding absolutely moronic.
    *   They shouldn't make ChatGPT like Gemini. Gemini sounds like a PR spokesperson. It's politically "neutral" to the point where its brains are falling out.

**[Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear | Jack Clark, Anthropic cofounder (Score: 25)](https://jack-clark.net/2025/10/13/import-ai-431-technological-optimism-and-appropriate-fear/)**

*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   goonGPT coming in December
    *   Would be nice if new "personality" was under a switch. Sometimes extremely dry responses are very nice, because model doesn't waste tokens and can pull out more information in a single response.
    *   That's fair in a way, people here were absolutely losing their minds in parasocial ways

*  **Summary:** This thread discusses the AI scaling problem.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Brilliant video, certainly adds an element of sanity to the current perception of AI
    *   Tldr: AI still can't self acquire knowledge and there's a data limit. The latter I'm not convinced. Humans acquire large amounts of data through our perceptions. Machines are still limited by mostly text based data.
    *   we don't need to scale compute. As proven by deepseek 3.2 and the jet nemotron architecture

**[If the singularity is certain, why tend to the consumer? (Score: 8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1o6i5te/if_the_singularity_is_certain_why_tend_to_the/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses why companies developing AI technology are focusing on consumer applications.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Because you need a MASSIVE amount of capital to get there. It's exactly the same as the Tesla thing - they need customers to make money to get to the point where they can print money themselves. At least in theory, if they are to be believed, of course.
    *   The user-base is the product. LLMs/AI/Singularity are the factory.
    *   Because you need money to make the thing.

*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Well I mean it's the simulacra . Unfortunately its not a simister plot just bureaucracy hierarchy capitalism
    *   dang- can i join your reality please
    *   No this time line tracks, the felon in chief and his far right white supremacists sycophants are accelerationists.
