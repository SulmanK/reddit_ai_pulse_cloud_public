**[*** AI accidentally generated an inappropriate image of minor (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1o6oruf/stupid_ai_accidentally_generated_an_inappropriate/)**
*  **Summary:** The user is reporting that AI accidentally generated an inappropriate image of a minor.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral, as users are mostly providing advice.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's unlikely to get you into trouble if you do it once and you deleted the image or didn't store it. If you keep doing it the website you're using will ban you or report you.
    *   You need to be careful when using LoRAs and enabling/disabling them while there is something like "girl" in your prompt.
    *   No one would know if you didn’t tell them.
