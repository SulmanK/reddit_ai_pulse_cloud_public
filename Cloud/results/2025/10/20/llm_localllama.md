*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It ships with DDR5 5600 which means ~87GB/s of bandwidth.
    *   That's nonsense, you'be be at around 3 tok/s (a bit more, but still well under 4 tok/s) with a dense 32B model at Q4.
    *   T1 will have around 1/3 the memory bandwidth that the X2 with ryzen 395 has. It'll be absurdly slow.

    *   No source-code, ollama wrapper (if you're going to build a wrapper, build around llama.cpp and give them actual credit) looks vibe coded by claude in a weekend(the gradients are a dead giveaway). What makes it stand out from openwebui or lm studio?
    *   There are youtube videos comparing these machines for inference.  Don't get the EVO-T1.
