**[Please keep your kids safe this Halloween (Score: 75)](https://i.redd.it/kdurnundeixf1.png)**
*  **Summary:** This is a post with the title "Please keep your kids safe this Halloween" and the comment "TNS name not found"
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  Not enough information to derive the top 3 points of view.

**[Is Partitioning data in Data Lake still the best practice? (Score: 44)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oge8vq/is_partitioning_data_in_data_lake_still_the_best/)**
*  **Summary:**  This thread discusses whether partitioning data in a data lake is still the best practice, with users debating the merits of partitioning versus liquid clustering and Z-ordering. The importance of considering cost motivations from companies like Snowflake and Databricks is also discussed.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with some positive sentiments related to performance improvements.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Partitioning allows for isolated operations on a lake table, enabling concurrent operations.
    *   Liquid clustering provides "virtual partitioning" that avoids rewriting data when the schema changes.
    *   Snowflake and Databricks make money on Compute. So when discussing 'performance improvements' to help make things go faster or run cheaper; it's important to keep these more subtle motivations in mind.

*  **Summary:** This thread questions the need for Kinesis Data Firehose. There is discussion around the cost configuration and throughput.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Firehose should cost significantly less than Kinesis itself.
    *   If you're mostly writing very small records, that could be why you're seeing higher cost.
    *   What’s your throughput? Maximum batch size and duration? Are you doing any transformations?

*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It sounds like you are wasting time building an automation for a broken process that should be rethought from the bottom up.
    *   Instead of this missuse of seed files. Create a g-sheet and synch that into the dwh in combination with some automations via n8n.
    *   Nothing that touches money should also touch AI.
