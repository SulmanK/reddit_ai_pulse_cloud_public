# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[ [D] What is Internal Covariate Shift?? (Score: 25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o7pgbl/d_what_is_internal_covariate_shift/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the concept of Internal Covariate Shift (ICS) and its relation to batch normalization (BatchNorm) in neural networks. It's mentioned that the original explanation for BatchNorm's effectiveness (reducing ICS) has been challenged by a MIT paper. The current understanding is that BatchNorm smooths the loss surface, allowing for larger learning rates.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Internal covariate shift is not the primary reason for the effectiveness of batch normalization.
    *   Batch normalization smooths the loss surface, enabling larger learning rates.
    *   Normalization layers help to stabilize intermediate layer outputs during backpropagation, making optimization easier.

*   **Summary:** This thread asks for the experiences of PhD students working at Mila in Quebec. Responses highlight the positive aspects of the environment, including good work-life balance, social activities, a collaborative research environment, and the enjoyable city of Montreal. The winter season is also mentioned as an intense but potentially rewarding experience.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Positive.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Mila offers a great research environment with supportive supervisors and collaborators.
    *   Montreal is an affordable and accessible city with a vibrant culture.
    *   Mila provides good compute resources and opportunities for industry collaboration.

**[ [R] Tensor Logic: The Language of AI (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o853h2/r_tensor_logic_the_language_of_ai/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the capabilities of Tensor Logic (TL), focusing on its ability to express certain rules and functions. It highlights the limitation of TL in compactly expressing rules that require function symbols, such as defining the length of a list.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Tensor Logic cannot compactly express rules requiring function symbols.
    *   TL puts functions outside, unlike Prolog which puts them inside.

**[ [D] Research on modelling overlapping or multi-level sequences? (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o8cm1j/d_research_on_modelling_overlapping_or_multilevel/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread seeks research recommendations for modeling overlapping or multi-level sequences. One response suggests looking into recent "Sentence Transformer" architecture papers, and another suggests  "Character-Level Language Modeling with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks"
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
