*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Smaller, fine-tuned models often outperform larger models on specific tasks and are more cost-effective.
    *   SLMs are particularly useful for enterprise applications and can be more reliable.
    *   There is room for both powerful generalized models and smaller specialist models.

**[[D] AAAI 26: Rebuttal cannot (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o26m9z/d_aaai_26_rebuttal_cannot/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread addresses the interpretation of AAAI 26 rebuttal guidelines. It differentiates between acceptable corrections or clarifications in a rebuttal and discouraged practices, such as presenting entirely new results that reviewers cannot properly evaluate.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral, focusing on clarifying the guidelines rather than expressing strong feelings.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Rebuttals should not introduce entirely new results that reviewers can't evaluate.
