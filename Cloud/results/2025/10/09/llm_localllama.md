# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[ReasonScape Evaluation: AI21 Jamba Reasoning vs Qwen3 4B vs Qwen3 4B 2507 (Score: 34)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o2b1yo/reasonscape_evaluation_ai21_jamba_reasoning_vs/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses the evaluation of AI21 Jamba's reasoning capabilities compared to Qwen3 4B, using the ReasonScape benchmark. Users analyze the performance of the models on different tasks.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is predominantly neutral, focusing on objective analysis and sharing of data.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's crucial to run your own private tests rather than relying solely on benchmarks.
    *   The Qwen3-4B model performed decently on Cars and Dates tasks but not on Letters because the model's training didn't include enough examples of how to end its internal reasoning process.
    *   The extra truncation on Jamba causes noticeably higher 95% CIs, making the task extra challenging from an evolution perspective.

**[yanolja/YanoljaNEXT-Rosetta-12B-2510 (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o2bm3z/yanoljayanoljanextrosetta12b2510/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread is centered on the yanolja/YanoljaNEXT-Rosetta-12B-2510 model. Users are requesting more details on its performance across different language pairs, particularly Korean/English translations.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a focus on seeking information and requesting data.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   There is a request for translation performance details of the language pairs.
    *   Someone is asking if the model can translate Ubykh , Kam ,naasioi , Â tlingit and nuer well.

**[I vibecoded an open source Grok Heavy emulator [CODE] (Score: 4)](https://github.com/valerka1292/OpenHeavy)**

*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive, with users expressing enthusiasm and appreciation for the project.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The project implements a bunch of the test-time-compute algorithms and has an openai compatible interface.
    *   The LLMs don't get as much smarter as anticipated using that strategy, and eats a ton of tokens.
    *   The UI looks clean and the code needs to be split out into maintainable modules.

**[Local LLMs vs. cloud for coding (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o2efiq/local_llms_vs_cloud_for_coding/)**
