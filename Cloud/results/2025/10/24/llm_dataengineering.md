# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[You need to build a robust ETL pipeline today, what would you do? (Score: 30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oexofz/you_need_to_build_a_robust_etl_pipeline_today/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread explores approaches to building robust ETL pipelines, taking into account data volume, source types, real-time requirements, and deployment environment (on-premise or cloud).  Participants discuss various tools and architectures, including Apache Airflow, native cloud services, and the Medallion Architecture.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with users providing objective advice and technical recommendations. One comment expresses a negative sentiment, joking about giving up when needing to stream petabytes of data, but it doesn't dominate the tone.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The choice of ETL tools depends on the cadence and expected growth of the data.  Scripting is suitable for small batches of APIs, while Apache Airflow is a good framework for larger needs.
    *   For on-premise orchestration, Apache Airflow is recommended. In the cloud, native services like Azure Fabric, AWS Glue, or Databricks are preferred. Consider Medallion Architecture for scalability.
    *   The robustness of a pipeline depends less on the underlying tech and more on the surrounding practices like observability, data quality, and governance.

**[Does a Star Schema always have only one fact table? How does this work in Power BI? (Score: 21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oeruou/does_a_star_schema_always_have_only_one_fact/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses whether star schemas must have only one fact table, especially in the context of Power BI. The discussion also covers the use of galaxy schemas and dimensional modeling.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with users providing factual information and sharing their experience.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Technically, a star schema has one fact table, while a dimensional model can have multiple. However, the terms are often used interchangeably.
    *   Power BI doesn't restrict you to a single fact table, as long as the data is dimensionally modeled.
    *   The key is to understand data modeling principles and optimize for data operations, rather than strictly adhering to the "star schema" concept.

**[Modern SQL engines draw fractals faster than Python?!? (Score: 18)](https://i.redd.it/yklx634ke3xf1.png)**
*  **Summary:** Users discuss the speed differences between SQL engines and Python for drawing fractals.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with users explaining the technical reasons for the performance differences.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Python, being an interpreted language, is inherently slower than SQL engines for tasks like fractal drawing.
    *   The choice between SQL and Python depends on development time vs. machine time.
    *   The user is not testing what they think they are testing.

**[How are you handling security compliance with AI tools? (Score: 13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oevtwo/how_are_you_handling_security_compliance_with_ai/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread discusses how organizations are handling security and compliance when using AI tools, especially concerning the risk of sensitive data leaving governed environments. Various strategies are shared, including using on-premise or private-cloud deployments, disabling data sharing with vendors, and implementing strict data governance controls.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, reflecting a professional exchange of strategies and concerns.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Using on-premise or private-cloud deployments of LLMs with strict data governance controls helps ensure data security while still leveraging AI.
    *   Most major AI vendors offer options to disable data sharing for model training, which can address compliance concerns.
    *   Locking the model inside a VPC and scrubbing data before it reaches the model using tools like Azure OpenAI with VNet or AWS Bedrock/SageMaker via PrivateLink provides a good balance between utility and security.
