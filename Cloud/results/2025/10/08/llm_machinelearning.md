**[[D] Bad Industry research gets cited and published at top venues. (Rant/Discussion) (Score: 35)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o1jdd7/d_bad_industry_research_gets_cited_and_published/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread is a discussion about the perceived issues of industry research being published and cited in top venues, with concerns raised about bias and the resources available to large industry labs.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mostly neutral, with some negative sentiment expressing frustration about bias in research publication.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Industry labs with many authors shouldn't publish in large conferences due to broad coverage.
    * Conference reviews should be double-blind to prevent bias.
    * Reviewers may intentionally limit papers from FAANG firms due to reserved spots for top companies.

**[[d] how to develop with LLMs without blowing up the bank (Score: 6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o15tog/d_how_to_develop_with_llms_without_blowing_up_the/)**
