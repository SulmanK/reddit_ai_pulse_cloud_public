# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[ [D] Struggling with separate Snowflake and Airflow environments for DEV/UAT/PROD - how do others handle this? (Score: 32)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oajs0h/struggling_with_separate_snowflake_and_airflow/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses different approaches to managing Snowflake and Airflow environments for development, UAT, and production. Users are sharing their experiences and recommendations on whether to use separate accounts or a single account with segregated databases.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone of the thread is neutral, as users are primarily sharing technical advice and experiences in an objective manner.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   **Single Snowflake Account with Separate Databases:** Many users recommend using a single Snowflake account with separate databases (and schemas) for each environment (DEV, UAT, PROD), leveraging RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for security. This approach is considered easier to manage.
    *   **Separate Snowflake Accounts:** Some users have experience with separate Snowflake accounts for each environment, but generally find it more complex and costly to manage, although useful for testing security.
    *   **Airflow Deployment Considerations:** For Airflow, opinions vary, with some finding separate deployments a headache but more understandable than separate Snowflake accounts. Some suggest using local-first development environments with tools like dbt or bruin to minimize the need for separate Airflow environments.

**[Company is paying for my next DE cert. Which one to choose right now ? (Score: 25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oafuv2/company_is_paying_for_my_next_de_cert_which_one/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread revolves around which data engineering certification to pursue, with various users offering advice based on their experiences and the perceived value of different certifications in the job market.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is mostly neutral, with users offering advice and opinions in an objective and informative way. There are slight variations depending on each users experience with a specific tool.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   **Cloud-Specific Certifications (AWS, GCP, Databricks):** Some users recommend focusing on certifications related to specific cloud platforms (AWS, GCP) or tools like Databricks, as they are widely used and can open doors to better roles.
    *   **Industry-Neutral Certifications (CDMP, AI Governance):** Other users suggest pursuing industry-neutral certifications like CDMP Associate or AI Governance, as they provide broader knowledge and are applicable across different domains.
    *   **Vendor Certifications vs. Theoretical Knowledge:** A different point of view emphasizes strengthening theoretical knowledge (database design, data modeling) rather than focusing solely on vendor-specific certifications, arguing that understanding fundamental concepts is more valuable in the long term.
