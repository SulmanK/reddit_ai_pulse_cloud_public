    *   The same user then expresses a desire to sleep and face the results tomorrow.
    *   (Only two points of view were available in the context).

**[[D] Tensorflow and Musicnn (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nzcg16/d_tensorflow_and_musicnn/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread discusses issues encountered while using Tensorflow and Musicnn, particularly related to CPU compatibility and floating-point operations. A solution involving disabling oneDNN optimizations and setting specific float configurations is proposed.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The original poster is experiencing issues with Musicnn on newer CPUs.
    *   Another user identifies the cause as TensorFlow's CPU backend and suggests a fix involving disabling oneDNN optimizations and setting float precision.
    *   The suggestion also includes converting the model to ONNX for stable results across different CPUs.

**[[P] Harmonic Agent: Tackling belief drift in self-reflective AI agents (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nzjjd6/p_harmonic_agent_tackling_belief_drift_in/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread introduces a "Harmonic Agent" designed to address belief drift in self-reflective AI agents. The agent uses an ordered belief system with varying learning rates to manage and refine beliefs.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The author proposes that beliefs in the agent should be ordered, with earlier beliefs having lower learning rates, representing more certain and immutable aims.
    *   Later beliefs, representing strategic guidance, can then be refined more easily by the reflection loop.
    *   The author draws an analogy to how programs handle exceptions, suggesting that belief failures shouldn't invalidate the entire belief system.
