# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[What happened to Longcat models? Why are there no quants available? (Score: 11)](https://huggingface.co/meituan-longcat/LongCat-Flash-Chat)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses why there are no quantized versions of Longcat models available. The reasons cited are the model's large size, lack of support by llama.cpp, and insufficient popularity to incentivize quant makers.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is Negative.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Longcat models are too large for llama.cpp.
    *   There's not enough demand to justify the effort of creating quantized versions.
    *   The computational cost of creating AWQ versions is a barrier.
