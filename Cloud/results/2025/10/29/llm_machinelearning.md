# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[P] Looking for Teammates for Kaggle competition : PhysioNet - Digitization of ECG Images (Score: 9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1oj54b5/p_looking_for_teammates_for_kaggle_competition/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread is a request for collaborators to participate in a Kaggle competition that focuses on digitizing ECG images.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is positive, expressing enthusiasm and offering helpful advice for the competition.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   ECG digitization from scanned images can be challenging due to image quality.
    *   ViT/VLM combinations are suitable for this type of task.
    *   Fine-tuning with Pix2Struct or Donut could be beneficial.

**[[D] What kind of live metrics would actually help you while training ML models? (Score: 8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1oixifu/d_what_kind_of_live_metrics_would_actually_help/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread explores which live metrics would be most helpful during the training of machine learning models.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is neutral, focusing on practical suggestions and insights.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Some suggested that it will reinvent MLFlow/wandb.
    *   Gradient flow visualization is considered more valuable than loss curves.
    *   Examining actual sample predictions is crucial, as metrics can be misleading.

**[[D]NLP conferences look like a scam.. (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ojeldl/dnlp_conferences_look_like_a_scam/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread presents the view that NLP conferences may be perceived as scams due to the high volume of incremental research and the challenges in the review process.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Many conference papers represent small, incremental improvements.
    *   Targeting top-tier conference proceedings (ICLR/ICML/NeurIPS) can help filter for more interesting work.
    *   Citation analysis and blog highlights can also help navigate the large volume of content.

**[[D] Looking for guidance on open-sourcing a hierarchical recommendation dataset (user–chapter–series interactions) (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ojcjk1/d_looking_for_guidance_on_opensourcing_a/)**
*  **Summary:** The user asks for guidance on open-sourcing a specific type of hierarchical recommendation dataset.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral and informative, with a focus on providing helpful suggestions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Recsys challenges could be useful source of information.
    *   Criteo datasets might have hierarchical data, but it is often obfuscated.

**[[P] Jira training dataset to predict development times — where to start? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1oiskv0/p_jira_training_dataset_to_predict_development/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the viability of using Jira data for predicting development times, raising concerns about data quality and practical value.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with some skepticism and negative sentiment expressed alongside neutral informative points.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Relying on story points to predict timelines is not effective. Actual cycle time data, PR sizes, and developer information are more relevant.
    *   Data quality is a significant challenge due to inconsistent updating of Jira tickets.
    *   The value of the model is questionable; direct communication with developers might be more effective.

**[[R] Confidential compute benchmark - TEE overhead for transformers consistently under 10% (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1oizuch/r_confidential_compute_benchmark_tee_overhead_for/)**
