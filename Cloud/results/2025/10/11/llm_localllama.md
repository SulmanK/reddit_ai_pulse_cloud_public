# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Fighting Email Spam on Your Mail Server with LLMs (Score: 33)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o3xluf/fighting_email_spam_on_your_mail_server_with_llms/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses using LLMs to fight email spam. Users suggest engaging with spammers to waste their time and resources, rather than simply ignoring them. An automated system could detect spam and message spammers back and forth.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral. Some positive sentiment emerges from users appreciating the idea.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The best way to fight spam is to discourage it by engaging with spammers.
    *   Shielding against spam can be more expensive than the spammer's "weapon".
    *   Using AI in bayesian spam filters could be a solution, but prompts need to be carefully designed to prevent bypassing instructions.

**[What rig are you running to fuel your LLM addiction? (Score: 28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o43qhn/what_rig_are_you_running_to_fuel_your_llm/)**
*  **Summary:** Users share their hardware configurations for running LLMs locally. Setups range from older, budget-friendly systems to high-end rigs with multiple GPUs.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a touch of positive sentiment expressed by some users about the satisfaction of testing models locally.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Users showcase their various setups, highlighting specific components like CPUs, GPUs, and RAM.
    *   Some users are running LLMs on relatively old and inexpensive hardware.
    *   Others have invested in powerful machines with multiple GPUs to achieve better performance.

**[Choosing a code completion (FIM) model (Score: 13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o42ch4/choosing_a_code_completion_fim_model/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses the selection of a code completion model, with recommendations for specific models, particularly focusing on FIM (Fill-In-the-Middle) capabilities.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral overall.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   nvim.llm supports regular models, which could be an alternative if hardware is constrained.
    *   The user gets 160-180tps on glm air with eagle decoding in fp8.
    *   Recommendation of using the q3 coder 30b model for actual FIM.

**[The LLM running on my local PC is too slow. (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o3zgy7/the_llm_running_on_my_local_pc_is_too_slow/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the reasons for slow LLM performance and suggests solutions like using Mixture of Experts (MoE) models and models that fit within the user's VRAM budget.
*  **Emotion:** Mixed, with some frustration about slow performance but also positive encouragement and helpful advice.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The current model is slow because it's a dense model and doesn't fit in the user's VRAM.
    *   MoE models like GLM 4.5 Air, GPT-OSS-120b, and Qwen3 30b are recommended for better performance with limited VRAM.
    *   Ensure that the model needs to be at least 75% on GPU and needs good ram speed.

**[LM Studio + Open-WebUI - no reasoning (Score: 6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o3z7q9/lm_studio_openwebui_no_reasoning/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread addresses the issue of reasoning not working correctly in LM Studio combined with Open-WebUI. Solutions involve using the new /responses endpoint in LM Studio and considering alternative interfaces like Cherry Studio AI.
*  **Emotion:** Mostly neutral, focused on problem-solving.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   LM Studio is automatically parsing the harmony template and using the /responses endpoint is the solution.
    *   Consider deleting OpenWebUI and switching to Cherry Studio AI with LMStudio API.
    *   Inference parameters might be overridden in OpenWebUI, which could be the cause of the issue.

**[How to use GLM Plan + Claude Plan with Claude Code on macOS (Score: 5)](https://gist.github.com/RuiNelson/a5af5620404a0a9fbf3cf3e92fe97585)**
*  **Summary:** This thread is about using GLM Plan and Claude Plan for coding on macOS, with one user sharing a "hack" for fellow Mac users. It involves comparing them to other coding assistants like Codex and Sonnet.
*  **Emotion:** Mostly neutral, with some negative sentiment towards Codex and positive sentiment for GLM-4.6 + CC.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Codex is considered a waste of time.
    *   GLM-4.6 + CC is hard to differentiate from Sonnet 4.1-4.5 and is affordable.
    *   The OP made a hack for fellow Mac users to improve coding.

**[Poor GPU Club : Anyone use Q3/Q2 quants of 20-40B Dense models? How's it? (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o3zz30/poor_gpu_club_anyone_use_q3q2_quants_of_2040b/)**
*  **Summary:** Users discuss their experience with Q3/Q2 quants of 20-40B Dense models.
*  **Emotion:** Mostly neutral, with some negative sentiment towards Q2 quantization.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Q2 quantization is generally not recommended as it produces nonsense.
    *   Qwen3-4B will be best on GPU models and Qwen3-30B models will be best split, and put enough layers on GPU to fill it in Q4_K_M.
    *   Qwen3 32b had noticeable difference in quality below Q4, unfortunately.

**[Optimize my environment for GLM 4.5 Air (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o42jx1/optimize_my_environment_for_glm_45_air/)**
*  **Summary:** This is about optimizing an environment for GLM 4.5 Air. The advices mostly are about hardware.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral, and focused on hardware requirements.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Ktransformers can be tried.
    *   It's unlikely you will be able to get third GPU without hardware issues. CPU/RAM upgrade wont help. The options are: Replace your GPUs with 3090 (or better); Invest time and money into hardware experiments; Go with Epyc/Xeon/Threadripper platform with multi-channel memory; Try another inference engine.
    *   Try qwen3 coder 30b.

**[Who makes the Code Supernova model that's available for free on KiloCode now? (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o42n2x/who_makes_the_code_supernova_model_thats/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around identifying the creator and assessing the quality of the Code Supernova model on KiloCode.
*  **Emotion:** Mostly neutral, with some positive sentiment about its perceived origin and capabilities.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's suggested that the model might be a Grok code checkpoint.
    *   Another viewpoint is that Qwen-coder-plus is way better, therefore there is no reason to use this model.
    *   It behaves like a grok model.

**[Best Bang for Buck? (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o3zk2l/best_bang_for_buck/)**
*  **Summary:** This post is focused on asking advice for choosing the best GPU.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Ampere has 4 years less runway than Blackwell in terms of model architecture and custom kernels.
    *   For a single 5060ti you can fit all of gpt-oss 20b with full context in the 16gb and it runs fast (100 t/s).
    *   Your only reasonable option from that list are the 3060 12GB and the 5060Ti 16GB and I would scrape together enough to go for the 5060Ti.

*  **Summary:** The post is about the potential effects of making LLMs overly cautious or paranoid.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   LLM is a predictor statistical model for one token following the input.
    *   Goody2.ai recommends not making any decisions or statements that could harm the user.
    *   It doesnâ€™t have feelings. You can just ask it to act like a paranoid developer if you want.
