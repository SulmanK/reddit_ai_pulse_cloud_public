# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[R] Continuous latent interpolation breaks geometric constraints in 3D generation (Score: 11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1oe6ywk/r_continuous_latent_interpolation_breaks/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses a research paper about how continuous latent interpolation can break geometric constraints when generating 3D objects. The discussion touches on the nature of latent spaces, differences between linear and manifold-aligned latent spaces, and the connection to research in computer graphics and medical imaging.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a hint of positivity.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Continuous representations may inherently have limitations in preserving geometric constraints.
    *   There's a difference between linear/unstructured latent spaces and manifold-aligned ones in terms of generating plausible samples.
    *   This problem is actively studied in computer graphics and medical imaging, where researchers consider 3D shapes belonging to non-Euclidean "shape spaces".
