# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[N] Pondering how many of the papers at AI conferences are just AI generated garbage. (Score: 114)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1od3j63/n_pondering_how_many_of_the_papers_at_ai/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread explores the concern that many papers at AI conferences might be AI-generated and whether the reviewing process is sufficient.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The consensus is that reputable conferences likely have minimal AI-generated submissions due to stringent review processes.
    *   Reproducibility of results is paramount, regardless of whether a paper is AI-generated.
    *   Some people are not reading million papers.

**[[N] Open AI just released Atlas browser. It's just accruing architectural debt (Score: 29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1od8zpw/n_open_ai_just_released_atlas_browser_its_just/)**
