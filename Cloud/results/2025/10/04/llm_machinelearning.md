# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[ [D] join pretraining or posttraining (Score: 32)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nxfyl8/d_join_pretraining_or_posttraining/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the pros and cons of join pretraining versus posttraining for machine learning models. Commenters debate which approach is more valuable, considering factors like engineering effort, cost, career opportunities, and personal interests.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with some negative sentiment expressing boredom with LLMs. Most comments are objective assessments of the two approaches.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Pretraining is more engineering-heavy and costly, but can lead to employment in labs training LLMs.
    *   Posttraining is more flexible and experiment-friendly, offering wider employment opportunities.
    *   The best approach depends on individual interests, with pretraining suited for those interested in model architectures and posttraining for those interested in algorithms or applications.

**[ [R] New paper shows that draws in LLM battles aren't what you think (Score: 24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nxb9bp/r_new_paper_shows_that_draws_in_llm_battles_arent/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses a new research paper about how draws in LLM battles should be interpreted, suggesting they don't necessarily mean the models are equally strong. Commenters discuss factors like the variability of queries, the potential for "evaluator concession" (declaring a draw due to lack of interest), and the need to consider the difficulty of prompts when evaluating models.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral. Commenters are engaged in analytical discussion about the paper's implications.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Draws in LLM battles may not accurately reflect the relative strengths of the models due to varying query difficulty.
    *   Evaluator disinterest can lead to draws, potentially skewing results.
    *   Extending the Elo algorithm with probability distributions and assigning uncertainty to prompts could improve LLM evaluation.

**[Internship at 'Big Tech' — PhD Student [D] (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nxy1z3/internship_at_big_tech_phd_student_d/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses strategies for PhD students to secure internships at big tech companies.  Topics include application processes, networking, the importance of research alignment, and the increasing competition for entry-level positions.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral. The comments provide advice and share personal experiences related to internships, maintaining a relatively objective tone.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Competition for tech internships is fierce. Networking and internal referrals can improve chances.
    *   Research alignment and skills are key factors in securing internships.
    *   Previous internship experience, especially at frontier labs, is highly valued.
