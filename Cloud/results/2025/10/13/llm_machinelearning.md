    *   Ensure you have the appropriate qualifications (e.g., a PhD) for the specific role.

**[[D] ICLR 2026 reviewer paper assignment? (Score: 29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o55qi1/d_iclr_2026_reviewer_paper_assignment/)**
*   **Summary:** Users are discussing the status of paper assignments for the ICLR 2026 conference, with many stating they have not yet received their assignments.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mostly Neutral, with a hint of Negative sentiment from a user who claims to have been blacklisted.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Many reviewers are still waiting for their assignments.
    *   Some speculate the assignments are delayed.
    *   One user believes they have been unfairly blacklisted from reviewing.

**[[D] Presenting NeurIPS paper at EurIPS (Score: 17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o5gdtr/d_presenting_neurips_paper_at_eurips/)**
*   **Summary:** The user is asking if presenting a paper at EurIPS counts as presenting at NeurIPS. The responses indicate that it does not, and that presenting at either the San Diego or Mexico City NeurIPS is required to avoid rejection.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is generally Neutral to Positive, providing information and potential solutions.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   EurIPS does not count as presenting at NeurIPS; presentation at NeurIPS (either SD or Mexico City) is required for publication.
    *   Someone else (an author) can present the paper in the user's place.
    *   In the worst case, registering for physical attendance at SD or Mexico counts as "presenting".

**[[D] Is it acceptable to resize datasets for experiments? (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o5ovoe/d_is_it_acceptable_to_resize_datasets_for/)**
*   **Summary:** The user is questioning the acceptability of resizing datasets for experiments.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Downsampling generally leads to worse performance than SotA (State of The Art).
    *   Downsampling isn't considered "cheating."
    *   Downsampling may prevent paper acceptance, as other models will also need to be trained on the same image resolution, which means more experiments will need to be done.

**[Detect over-compressed images in a dataset? [P] (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o5qp3c/detect_overcompressed_images_in_a_dataset_p/)**
*   **Summary:** The user is seeking advice on how to detect over-compressed images within a dataset.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   A synthetic dataset could be created by compressing your own images, and then train a classifier or a regression estimating the quality the image was saved with.

**[[D] are world models primarily for visual worlds or the underlying technology can also help in build a model for engineering infra (like services and the connections between them and infra)?
