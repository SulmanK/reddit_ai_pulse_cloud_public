*  **Summary:** User needs help setting up open-webui.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   That's not comparable. Behind Mistrals API most likely runs a full blown model. Ollama (🤮) uses llama.cpp (❤️) as backend and thus runs quantized models in GGUF format. To have more control use pure llama.cpp llama-server component and get rid of Ollama.

**[Looking for models that are good for product design (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oihxvc/looking_for_models_that_are_good_for_product/)**
*  **Summary:** User is looking for models that are good for product design.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   You could try GLM-4.5V? At such "small" model sizes though, world knowledge will be limited.
    *   Mind sharing a little about the kinds of hallucinations you're seeing? Do these need real-world knowledge or are they simply taking inputs and creating narratives from those? The process itself might help identify the right models to consider.
    *   I would suggest if using local models and experiencing lots of hallucinations you might need to check the correct spec for the configs for the models. They can be pretty sensitive to the right temp / top P / top K etc

**[reduce cost on livekit voice agent by using free models on livekit (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oi5y5y/reduce_cost_on_livekit_voice_agent_by_using_free/)**
*  **Summary:** User seeking to reduce cost of livekit voice agent by using free models on livekit.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is negative.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Your fundamental premise is wrong - livekit supports a particular style of api that's based on proprietary offerings, but you can swap any opanai api call for an equivalent server that does the same thing,  stt,tts,llm.  Just set up opanai compliant apis for each service somewhere (local/cloud) and point livekit at those.

*  **Summary:** User asks if the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 --EVO-X2 AI Mini PC -- 128 GB Ram will hold its value of around 1.8k in two years time.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   No. It'll likely tank hard in 2027.
    *   This is a first-generation product. Most of what you're paying for is the fact the RAM is GPU-accessible. In 2 years AMD will release a chip that's around twice as fast, which will tank the value of this product. 2027/2028 is the next consumer GPU product
    *   Strix Halo is just a CPU with a good iGPU and a four channel memory interface. Intel could do that tomorrow if they wanted to, but they don't because they are afraid of cannibalizing their profit margins.

*  **Summary:** User asks about using multiple terminal AI working together for the same project.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Various people do various things. I doubt anyone will run 2 agents on the same codebase but for example gemini-cli working on backend and codex working on frontend - why not?
    *   You can if putting one llm on one branch of code and another on another git branch.
