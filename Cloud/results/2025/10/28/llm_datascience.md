(Score: 38)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ohsucs/for_an_ab_test_where_the_user_is_the/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the appropriateness of using a standard two-proportion z-test for A/B testing when the randomization unit is the user and the primary metric is a ratio (conversions/impressions). Several alternative methods like GLM with Wald test, Delta method, Poisson bootstrap, and GLMM are suggested.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral. The comments primarily focus on providing technical advice and solutions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   A standard z-test might be inappropriate due to the varying number of impressions per user.
    *   GLM with Wald test is a better option.
    *   Delta method or t-test on linearized metric are practical solutions. Consider Poisson bootstrap or GLMM as alternatives.
