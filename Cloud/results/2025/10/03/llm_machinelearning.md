# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[N] Stanford is updating their Deep Learning course on YouTube (Score: 145)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nwhihj/n_stanford_is_updating_their_deep_learning_course/)**
*  **Summary:**  This thread is about the announcement that Stanford is updating their Deep Learning course on YouTube. People are generally excited and appreciative of the update.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive and neutral, with users expressing thanks and interest.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Excitement about the updated course material.
    *   Gratitude for sharing the information.
    *   Request to be reminded about the course.

**[[R] New paper: LLMs don't have privileged self knowledge, which means we can efficiently train a General Correctness Model to predict the correctness of multiple models. Surprising or expected? (Score: 15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nwoxqz/r_new_paper_llms_dont_have_privileged_self/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses a new paper claiming that LLMs do not possess privileged self-knowledge. This could enable the development of a General Correctness Model for predicting the accuracy of various models.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is predominantly neutral, with some positive sentiment.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The finding aligns with existing experience, where models trained on curated examples outperform individual models.
    *   LLM generation may be low entropy, making it easier to predict correctness with a separate model.
    *   If LLMs become globally interactive, their lack of self-knowledge could affect our own.

**[[R] Thesis direction: mechanistic interpretability vs semantic probing of LLM reasoning? (Score: 6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nwfn4j/r_thesis_direction_mechanistic_interpretability/)**
*  **Summary:**  A student is seeking advice on choosing a thesis direction between mechanistic interpretability and semantic probing of LLM reasoning.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mostly neutral and slightly positive, with commenters providing guidance and opinions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Focus on scoping the project to ensure completion within the given timeframe.
    *   Semantic probing may be more useful for applied LLM work, while mechanistic interpretability is more useful for research and engineering.
    *   Consider the value of the skill being developed over the specific material.
