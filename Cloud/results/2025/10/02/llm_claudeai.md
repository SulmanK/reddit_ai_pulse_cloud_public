*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   None of them ever know what model they are.
    *   It is so odd to me that no LLM understands which model it is. This seems intentional. It would be SO EASY for them to feed the LLM the knowledge of what model they are.
    *   If that is important to you, include it in the system prompt and call it a day.
