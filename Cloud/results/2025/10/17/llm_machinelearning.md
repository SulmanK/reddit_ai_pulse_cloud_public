# Detailed Analysis by Thread

**[[R] Plain English outperforms JSON for LLM tool calling: +18pp accuracy, -70% variance (Score: 74)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o8szk0/r_plain_english_outperforms_json_for_llm_tool/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses a paper that claims using plain English instead of JSON for LLM tool calling improves accuracy and reduces variance. Users share their experiences and ask questions about the methodology and implications.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive and neutral. Many comments express interest and appreciation for the work.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The research is interesting and the results make intuitive sense, since models are trained on natural text.
    *   Tool calling is usually a separate training stage, so it should be aligned to the JSON format. The commenter wonders if the Berkeley Function-calling Benchmark was tested.
    *   Natural language may outperform structured output (JSON) for tool selection, but structured output is necessary for specifying precise parameters, making natural language overkill in some cases.

**[[D] What ML/AI research areas are actively being pursued in industry right now? (Score: 38)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o8ve9w/d_what_mlai_research_areas_are_actively_being/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the most active areas of ML/AI research in industry, including NLP, LLMs, reinforcement learning, drug discovery, on-device AI, and ML systems.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with users sharing their perspectives and observations.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   NLP, particularly post-training of LLMs, is a major area of focus.
    *   Drug discovery and other life-science related ML is emerging.
    *   On-device AI is a growing area, involving model compression and efficient architectures.

**[[P] Control your house heating system with RL (Score: 17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o8zbg5/p_control_your_house_heating_system_with_rl/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses a project where reinforcement learning is used to control a house heating system. The central theme is whether RL is the most appropriate approach for this task, compared to more traditional control methods.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with some skepticism and constructive criticism.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   RL is unnecessary, and the same task could be accomplished with PID controllers.
    *   The project is a solution in search of a problem, as simpler methods from control theory already solve this.
    *   There are concerns about the system's behavior during the "exploration" phase of RL.

**[[D] GCP credits vs mac book Pro 5 vs Nvidia DGX? (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o96m84/d_gcp_credits_vs_mac_book_pro_5_vs_nvidia_dgx/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread is a discussion comparing the benefits of using GCP credits versus purchasing a Macbook Pro or Nvidia DGX for machine learning tasks.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with users sharing their opinions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   GCP credits are better value than a high-end laptop because cloud instances are more powerful for model training.
    *   Vast.ai and Runpod offer better prices per hour than GCP.
    *   A DGX or high-end MacBook can be useful for running local assistants, but are limited for batch processing.

**[[D] Review 0 paper in ICLR 2026? (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1o9207g/d_review_0_paper_in_iclr_2026/)**
