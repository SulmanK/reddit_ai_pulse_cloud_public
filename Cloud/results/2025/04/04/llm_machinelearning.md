    *   The discussion centers on the best XAI (Explainable AI) method to use for CNNs in medical imaging. Users suggest consulting with customers to understand their needs, conducting surveys with medical professionals, and comparing segmented ground masks.

# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[R] Anthropic: Reasoning Models Don’t Always Say What They Think (Score: 40)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jr6iqj/r_anthropic_reasoning_models_dont_always_say_what/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses an Anthropic paper about reasoning models not always expressing their true thoughts. It explores the potential misinterpretation of this behavior as "lying" and considers the broader implications for interpretability and the tendency to anthropomorphize LLMs.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Reasoning models optimizing for outputs, not truthfulness.
    *   The comparison to human thought processes.
    *   The concern over anthropomorphizing LLMs and over-attributing intent.

**[What is your practical NER (Named Entity Recognition) approach? [P] (Score: 11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jr8klg/what_is_your_practical_ner_named_entity/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses various approaches to practical Named Entity Recognition (NER). Suggested methods include using VLMs, fine-tuning small models like DistilBERT, and utilizing frameworks like GoLLIE, as well as leveraging resources like Kaggle competitions.
*  **Emotion:** The thread has a slightly positive emotional tone, driven by suggestions and helpful advice.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Using VLMs (like GPT4o or Qwen2.5vl) for extracting text from images and performing pseudo-NER.
    *   Fine-tuning smaller models like DistilBERT for local/offline NER using tools like ONNX or TensorFlow Lite, starting with a labeled dataset.
    *   Leveraging the GoLLIE framework, an ICLR 2024 paper, for SOTA information extraction, including NER.
