# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Chinese response bug in tokenizer suggests Quasar-Alpha may be from OpenAI (Score: 201)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jrd0a9/chinese_response_bug_in_tokenizer_suggests/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses a potential Chinese response bug found in the tokenizer of the Quasar-Alpha model. Users are exploring whether this bug indicates a connection to OpenAI, as the same issue exists in GPT models. They are also investigating how to replicate the bug using OpenAI's `tiktoken` library. Some users have tested other models and found the same issue, while others are skeptical that this implies the entire model comes from OpenAI.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with some instances of Positive sentiment expressing interest and appreciation for the "detective work" done in identifying the bug.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The bug in the tokenizer suggests a possible link between Quasar-Alpha and OpenAI.
    * The presence of the bug doesn't necessarily mean the entire model is from OpenAI, only that they might be using the same tokenizer.
    * The bug can be replicated using OpenAI's `tiktoken` library and is present in other models as well.
