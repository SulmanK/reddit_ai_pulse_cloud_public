    *   Application are an interface for humans to do certain stuff.
If AI does everything there is no need for an interface anymore and therefore for a specialised app.
    *   Yup. I think over the next year or two vibe coding evolves into “personal apps,” I.e. instead of shopping for the perfect app you can make your own that’s tailored to your needs.
    *   Fundamentally all things that can be done by a butler in life should be done by an agent/llm. I entrust my butler that he chooses the best life insurance/groceries

*   **Summary:** The post's discussion includes weak wage pass-through and increased productivity.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Ask to Duolinguo or similar companies, or freelance translators and copywriter: the work transformation with llms usually is not gradual and continuous, because the ability of a model to replace an employee comes usually in a single model generation, literally in the time of a single release
    *    Yeah, nobody's going to work harder for no reason. If people aren't going to be compensated for increased productivity then they will just do the same amount of work with less effort using AI.

*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *    If I were a time traveler the 1940s would be one of the last places I'd risk going... The other is 2025.
    *    In 1940s computers had manual input. Storing the model would have to be done on punch cards. They only fit about 80 bytes each.
    *    You realize that to have a GPT-4 level model you need to train it first which is equivalent to trillions of inferences? Not even talking about the fact that you need to have the data which didn't exist because the internet didn't exist.
