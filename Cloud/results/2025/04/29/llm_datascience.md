# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] The role of data science in the age of GenAI (Score: 125)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1kanby4/the_role_of_data_science_in_the_age_of_genai/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion centers around the role of data science in the age of GenAI, particularly the impact of LLMs. Some argue that LLMs are not always sufficient, especially for state-of-the-art performance under constraints. Others note the continued importance of traditional data science skills, particularly in areas like experimentation, time-series analysis, and causal inference. There's a shift towards integrating APIs and managing infrastructure, but also opportunities for applying DS skills in the GenAI world, such as fine-tuning and designing evaluation pipelines.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, reflecting a balanced discussion of the changing landscape of data science. While some comments convey enthusiasm about the potential of GenAI, others express concerns about the shift in roles and the need to adapt. A single comment expresses positive emotion regarding building full-stack generative AI products.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   LLMs are not always sufficient for specific, constrained tasks, requiring tailored solutions and expertise in model distillation and optimization.
    *   Traditional data science skills like causal inference, experimentation, and time-series analysis remain crucial and are not easily replaced by GenAI.
    *   The role of data scientists is evolving towards integrating APIs, managing infrastructure, and designing evaluation pipelines for GenAI models, rather than solely building models.

**[Transition to SDE (Score: 9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1kapuvz/transition_to_sde/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses the transition from a data science role to a software development engineer (SDE) position. The advice focuses on building a GitHub portfolio with SDE projects, particularly those that bridge data analysis with frontend/backend skills. Interview preparation should focus on data structures, algorithms, and system design.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Building a portfolio of SDE projects, especially those incorporating data analysis, is crucial.
    *   Preparation for SDE interviews should focus on data structures, algorithms, and system design.
    *   A data science background is valuable in SDE roles in product companies due to the ability to code and understand data.

**[is it data leakage? (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1kaki1s/is_it_data_leakage/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses a potential data leakage issue related to a "conversion" feature in a dataset used for prediction. The discussion explores various approaches to identify and mitigate data leakage, including analyzing feature correlations, out-of-time testing, and understanding the data collection and update process.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral. There are also a couple of comments with a negative emotional tone in which feature is described as "crappy".
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Careful analysis of the data collection and update process is essential to identify potential sources of data leakage.
    *   Testing for data leakage involves comparing model performance with and without the suspicious feature, and using out-of-time validation.
    *   Mitigating data leakage may involve anonymizing or randomizing problematic features, but this must be done carefully to avoid introducing bias.
