# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] ICML 2025 - what if reviewers don't acknowledge rebuttal? (Score: 26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1js1ucr/d_icml_2025_what_if_reviewers_dont_acknowledge/)**
*   **Summary:**  The thread discusses the issue of reviewers at ICML 2025 not acknowledging or addressing author rebuttals.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotion is a mix of Negative, Neutral, and Positive sentiments. The negative sentiment arises from the feeling of helplessness when reviewers ignore rebuttals, while the neutral sentiment comes from referencing the Peer Review FAQ. The positive sentiment may be sarcastic.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   There is nothing that can be done if a reviewer ignores a rebuttal.
    *   According to the Peer Review FAQ, ACs should downweight reviews if rebuttals are ignored.
    *   Some users report that most of their reviewers did not read their rebuttal.

**[[R] Novel Logic-Enhanced LLM for Improved Symbolic Reasoning (Score: 12)](https://marqcodes.com/logicEnhanced.html)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion revolves around a novel logic-enhanced LLM for improved symbolic reasoning, particularly focusing on its architecture and performance gains.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral with a hint of Positive. The neutral sentiment comes from technical questions and objective observations, while the positive sentiment arises from expressing interest and applauding the work.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Questions about the number of parameters added to the baseline and if the improvements are due to the extra parameters or architecture.
    *   Inquiry about how logic identification is used (attention weights or output) and suggestions for using quantifiers in the input.
    *   The work is interesting for hybrid architectures of transformers with neurosymbolic architectures.

**[KDD 2025 [Cycle 2] Reviews Are Out! (Score: 11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jrxh39/kdd_2025_cycle_2_reviews_are_out/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread announces that KDD 2025 Cycle 2 reviews have been released and prompts questions about the review process.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is largely Neutral, reflecting informational and inquisitive sentiment.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Questions about whether scored parameters differ for Research and Applied Tracks.
    *   Inquiry about the metrics to focus on in the absence of an accept/reject metric.

**[[D] Are Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) used in real world scenarios? Is there anything out there that works? (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1js0tvk/d_are_domain_adversarial_neural_networks_dann/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread asks if Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) are used in real-world scenarios and if there are effective alternatives.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is primarily Neutral, expressing interest and sharing experiences.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   There has been a lot of research but no one has figured out which significantly outperforms normal empirical risk minimization in general.
    *   Starting with a pretrained ImageNet classifier gives greater performance improvement than most DG techniques.

**[[Discussion] This might be a really dumb question regarding current training method... (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1js6jd9/discussion_this_might_be_a_really_dumb_question/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread is about a question related to the current training method.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Neutral overall, with users giving technical explanations and suggestions.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Local minima problem has been solved since Boltzman Machines' arrival.
    *   Questions about the user starting with smaller models and then adding on to the network.
    *   Local minima are not the problem of current models.

**[[R] Fraud undersampling or oversampling? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jrn140/r_fraud_undersampling_or_oversampling/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread asks about the best sampling strategy for fraud detection, specifically whether to use undersampling or oversampling.
