# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Why are more people not excited by Polars? (Score: 114)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kbbgjb/why_are_more_people_not_excited_by_polars/)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion explores why Polars, a DataFrame library, isn't more widely adopted, comparing it to Pandas, Spark, DuckDB, and SQL. Reasons cited include the maturity and existing use of other tools, the size of datasets, and the preference for SQL.  Some users expressed enthusiasm for Polars, particularly for smaller workloads and Kafka integration.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with a slight leaning towards positive from individuals who are currently using Polars.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Existing tools like Pandas and Spark are already sufficient for many use cases, making refactoring a tough sell.
    *   For very large datasets, SQL databases and Spark are preferred over DataFrame libraries.
