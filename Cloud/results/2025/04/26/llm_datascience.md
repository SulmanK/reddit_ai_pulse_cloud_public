**[Thought I was prepping for ML/DS internships... turns out I need full-stack, backend, cloud, AND dark magic to qualify (Score: 167)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1k804yc/thought_i_was_prepping_for_mlds_internships_turns/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion centers on the surprisingly broad skillset now expected for Machine Learning/Data Science internships. Many feel that these roles now require more full-stack, backend, and cloud knowledge than initially anticipated.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, but with a hint of frustration and concern about the rising expectations for entry-level positions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Entry-level positions require a knowledge of a mid-level individual contributor.
    *   Focus on larger companies with established data science teams where you can learn from experienced people.
    *   Universities have mislead students into thinking they can get entry-level ML/DS jobs straight out of university.

**[This environment would be a real nightmare for me. (Score: 42)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1k8hjp4/this_environment_would_be_a_real_nightmare_for_me/)**

*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   UK style plugs are over engineered for electrical safety, but under engineered for physical safety and pain avoidance.
    *   No p value < 0.05, so who's to say if you're actually right or not!
    *   It is one of the example where mechanical/causal theory would be we much better to explain variation.

**[Question about How to Use Churn Prediction (Score: 22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1k80mxy/question_about_how_to_use_churn_prediction/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion explores various ways to utilize churn prediction models beyond simple identification of at-risk customers. Discussions include investigating reasons for churn, designing targeted interventions, and considering the ROI of such actions.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Churn models can be used for identifying churn drivers to action and coming up with interventions to adress those drivers.
    *   Carl Gold's book 'Fighting Churn with Data' takes the approach of creating deciles from the churn predictions i.e. 10% least likely to churn through to 10% most likely.
    *   The next step is to hypothesize about why customers are likely to churn. Then it's about designing possible mitigations.
