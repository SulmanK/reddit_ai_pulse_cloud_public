# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] New reasoning benchmark got released. Gemini is SOTA, but what's going on with Qwen? (Score: 86)](https://i.redd.it/a6awqhrhmtwe1.jpeg)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the performance of various language models on a new reasoning benchmark. Gemini is noted as the state-of-the-art (SOTA), and there is speculation on why Qwen's performance might be lower, possibly due to its smaller size and training data. There are also comments questioning the validity of OpenAI's ARC-AGI scores, suggesting potential overfitting or cheating.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a slight positive sentiment in some comments due to the excitement around Gemini's performance.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Gemini is performing very well on the new reasoning benchmark.
    *   Qwen's lower performance could be due to its smaller size and limited training data.
    *   There are suspicions that OpenAI might be overfitting or cheating to achieve high scores on certain benchmarks like ARC-AGI.

**[RTX 5090 LLM Benchmarks - outperforming the A100 by 2.6x (Score: 48)](https://blog.runpod.io/rtx-5090-llm-benchmarks-for-ai-is-it-the-best-gpu-for-ml/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread centers around a benchmark of the RTX 5090 GPU for LLM tasks. Several users express skepticism regarding the reported performance, especially the claim that it outperforms the A100 by 2.6x. Concerns are raised about the methodology, specifically the fixed generation length, and the practicality of using such a powerful GPU for smaller models.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mixed. While there is excitement about the new hardware, skepticism and doubt dominate. Some users express frustration at the difficulty of obtaining the new cards.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The benchmark results are likely inaccurate or misleading due to methodological flaws.
    *   The RTX 5090 is probably overkill for smaller models and should be compared with larger models.
    *   The focus on consumer-grade GPUs for LLMs is somewhat misguided since large language models require a very high VRAM (128GB+).

**[Deepcogito Cogito v1 preview 14B Quantized Benchmark (Score: 31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k6xczy/deepcogito_cogito_v1_preview_14b_quantized/)**
