# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[ [D] Tensorflow/Keras vs PyTorch for industry? (Score: 23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1jpq0x1/tensorflowkeras_vs_pytorch_for_industry/)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion centers around the choice between Tensorflow/Keras and PyTorch for industry applications. Arguments are made for both frameworks, with some suggesting PyTorch is more modern while others emphasize that the best framework is the one required by the job. It is also mentioned that Keras is great to train an iris classifier but doing something interesting gets harder.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with some positive sentiments expressed when discussing the ease of use of certain frameworks.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The most important framework is the one your job uses, and learning one makes it easy to learn the other.
    *   PyTorch is considered the more modern and better approach.
    *   PyTorch Lightning is more flexible and Keras is great to train an iris classifier but doing something interesting gets harder.

**[ Feel guilty for getting colleagues fired (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1jpte6g/feel_guilty_for_getting_colleagues_fired/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the ethical dilemma of implementing AI and automation solutions that lead to job displacement. Contributors share their experiences and feelings of guilt associated with such implementations. The discussions point out that a team of 40 accountants doing menial tasks might be overstaffed, and automation is happening to cut costs.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is negative, with feelings of guilt and concern about the impact of automation on employment.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Implementing automation is a business decision that would happen with or without an individual's involvement, and impacts lower-performing positions.
    *   The automation may not be AI but a process automation. It is not possible for AI to reason and provide key insights without a person interpretation of the results.
    *   Automation frees up time for more important tasks and innovation, although it may lead to job losses.
