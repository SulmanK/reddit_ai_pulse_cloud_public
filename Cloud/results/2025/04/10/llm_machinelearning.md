# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[ [D] Yann LeCun Auto-Regressive LLMs are Doomed (Score: 203)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jvrk68/d_yann_lecun_autoregressive_llms_are_doomed/)**
*  **Summary:**  This thread revolves around Yann LeCun's assertion that autoregressive LLMs are fundamentally flawed. Users debate his arguments, discuss potential counterarguments, and consider the future of LLM architectures.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone of the thread is mixed. While many comments exhibit a neutral tone as they dissect LeCun's arguments, there's also a presence of both positive and negative sentiments. Positive sentiments arise from those who agree with LeCun or see potential in alternative approaches, while negative sentiments stem from disagreement with his assessment and defense of existing autoregressive models.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   **LeCun's Argument:** Autoregressive LLMs are inherently limited due to the exponential decrease in the probability of generating a completely correct sequence as the sequence length increases.
    *   **Counterargument: LLMs can recover from errors:** LLMs can correct themselves mid-generation, mitigating the impact of individual token errors.
    *   **Autoregressive models are still SOTA:** Despite potential limitations, autoregressive models remain the leading architecture for current state-of-the-art models.
