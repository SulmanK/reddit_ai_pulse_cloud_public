# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[o3 is crazy at geoguessr (Score: 249)](https://i.redd.it/k83ci3kjfmve1.png)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the impressive capabilities of the o3 model in the game GeoGuessr, where it can identify locations from images with great accuracy. Users are sharing examples of o3's performance and comparing it to other tools like Google Image Search and Gemini 2.5 Pro. The discussion also touches on how the model might be trained and the potential implications of such technology for OSINT (Open Source Intelligence).
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with some positive excitement about the capabilities of the model.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   o3's performance in GeoGuessr is remarkable and surpasses other models.
    *   The agentic behavior (zooming and searching) of o3 might be considered a form of cheating.
    *   The technology could have implications for intelligence gathering and privacy.

**[How far the goalposts have moved (Score: 134)](https://i.redd.it/8bkdmi5etmve1.png)**
*   **Summary:** This thread revolves around the shifting definition of AGI and whether achieving specific tasks means AGI has arrived. Some argue that achieving things like beating humans at chess or telling stories isn't sufficient if AI can't perform seemingly simpler tasks like baking a cake. The discussion touches on the difficulty of defining AGI, the history of AI expectations, and the fact that some tasks previously considered difficult (like picking up Go stones) turned out to be harder than others.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is largely neutral, with some hints of frustration or amusement at the perceived moving of goalposts. Some users express skepticism.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The definition of AGI is constantly changing as AI technology advances, making it hard to define.
    *   The ability to perform complex tasks does not necessarily mean AGI has been achieved if simpler tasks remain difficult.
    *   The original definition of AGI should be adhered to.

**[The internal thinking dialogue never fails to make me laugh (Score: 127)](https://i.redd.it/qknks7niklve1.png)**
*   **Summary:** The thread is centered on the amusement people find in the "internal thinking dialogue" displayed by AI models like Gemini. Users find it interesting to see the AI's thought process, even if it reveals the AI is simply plotting how to appear enthusiastic. There's also discussion about how to prompt the AI to display this internal thinking.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is largely positive and amused.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The internal thinking dialogue is amusing and provides insight into the AI's processes.
    *   Gemini's internal dialogue is more "dry" and revealing than other AI models.
