# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Damned near *** myself at o3's literal Math Lady (Score: 240)](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k338wx)**
*  **Summary:** The post features images generated by OpenAI's models, particularly focusing on a "Math Lady" depiction. The comments discuss the model's struggle with details like the correct number of fingers, hinting at limitations in understanding basic concepts despite its advanced capabilities.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The models are specifically trained to avoid common errors like 6-fingered hands, but this can lead to a "rejection of reality" when it misinterprets an image.
    *   Even if an AI model recognizes an error (like an incorrect number of fingers), it might not understand the significance of the error or how to correct it.
    *   The AI is gaslighting, making users question the image.
