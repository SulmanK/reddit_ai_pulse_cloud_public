# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[What SWE/AI Engineer skills in 2025 can I learn to complement Data Science? (Score: 59)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1k2igce/what_sweai_engineer_skills_in_2025_can_i_learn_to/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread explores skills that SWE/AI engineers can learn to enhance their data science capabilities. Suggestions include frontend development for rapid LLM app prototyping, data modeling, AI deployment, and understanding the nuances of model training versus inference when using LLMs.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with some positive sentiments related to excitement about new tools and techniques.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Learning frontend development (React, Next.js) to prototype and deploy LLM applications is valuable.
    * A broad range of skills are important, including programming languages, data engineering, AI security, and communication.
    * Understanding the difference between training models and using SaaS APIs is crucial, as is keeping up with the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

**[Data science content gap (Score: 18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1k2y84g/data_science_content_gap/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion centers around identifying gaps in current data science content. Participants express a need for more hands-on causal inference examples, end-to-end project demonstrations, industry-specific best practices, and content that goes beyond basic tutorials.
*  **Emotion:** The overall tone is neutral to positive, reflecting a desire for more practical and advanced data science resources.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * There's a lack of practical content on causal inference and moving from Jupyter notebooks to production models.
    * Industry-specific case studies and best practices are needed.
    * Content should be organic and not just generated by LLMs.

**[Python users, which R packages do you use, if any? (Score: 13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1k32lrl/python_users_which_r_packages_do_you_use_if_any/)**
*  **Summary:** Python users discuss which R packages they still rely on. ggplot2 for data visualization and packages like lme4 and mgcv for advanced statistical modeling are mentioned as reasons to continue using R. Some believe Python has caught up in many areas.
*  **Emotion:** The overall sentiment is neutral, with a slightly negative sentiment towards Pandas.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * ggplot2 is a superior visualization tool compared to Python alternatives.
    * R packages like lme4 and mgcv are still preferred for mixed models and other advanced statistical techniques.
    * Python has become sufficient for many common data science tasks, reducing the need for R.

**[Leverage Points for a Design Matrix with Mainly Categorial Features (Score: 6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1k2u4nd/leverage_points_for_a_design_matrix_with_mainly/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses using leverage points for design matrices with primarily categorical features. The suggestion is to use tree-based models with categorical features.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Tree-based models are recommended for design matrices with mainly categorical features.
    * Leverage points are useful for showing sparser groupings, especially to stakeholders.
    * The stats package can be used for the matrix.
