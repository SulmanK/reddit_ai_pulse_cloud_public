# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[P] I made a bug-finding agent that knows your codebase (Score: 36)](https://i.redd.it/uchcb9jmpbxe1.gif)**
*  **Summary:**  A user created a bug-finding agent using LLMs that analyzes code changes between local and remote branches to identify potential issues.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The agent analyzes diffs between local and remote branches.
    * An LLM agent gathers context on how the changed code interacts with the codebase.
    * A reasoning model audits the change and its effects.

**[[R] 62.3% Validation Accuracy on Sequential CIFAR-10 (3072 length) With Custom RNN Architecture – Is it Worth Attention? (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1k910g9/r_623_validation_accuracy_on_sequential_cifar10/)**
*  **Summary:** A user presents their custom RNN architecture achieving 62.3% validation accuracy on Sequential CIFAR-10, questioning if it warrants further attention.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The accuracy is low for the number of parameters used compared to State Space Models.
    * Benchmarking on tasks like audio classification and comparison with Mamba-based models is suggested.
    * Clarification is requested regarding the purpose and usage of recurrency with independent image inputs.

**[[D]What are the best practices for getting information from the internet to train an AI model for commercial use? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1k8sn51/dwhat_are_the_best_practices_for_getting/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around the legal and ethical considerations of using data scraped from the internet to train AI models for commercial purposes.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * It's risky to train on data without a license, as there's no clear legal precedent for "Fair Use" in commercial AI training.
    *  Facts are not copyrightable in the USA, but the way data is arranged can be copyrighted. Datasets containing images are more complicated.
    * If the data has value, you should pay for it.
