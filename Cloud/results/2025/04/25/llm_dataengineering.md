**[ Woken up by a mystery incident caused by an untracked SQL fix? üåù Hope you haven't been there ... (Score: 172)](https://i.redd.it/zt5n3lcjcywe1.png)**
*  **Summary:**  Users share relatable experiences and express the challenges of dealing with untracked SQL fixes and the importance of documentation.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is predominantly neutral. There is a mix of negative sentiments related to the frustrations caused by untracked SQL fixes, and some positive sentiments from those who can relate.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The lack of documentation in SQL projects can lead to phobias and difficulties in maintenance.
    *   Proper documentation is crucial, but finding examples for huge SQL queries can be challenging.
    *   Experiencing incidents caused by untracked SQL fixes is a common and frustrating occurrence.

**[ Best approach for reading partitioned Parquet data: Python (Pandas/Polars) vs AWS Athena? (Score: 15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k7lp9q/best_approach_for_reading_partitioned_parquet/)**
*  **Summary:** Discussion about the optimal method for reading partitioned Parquet data, comparing Python libraries like Pandas and Polars with AWS Athena.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone of the thread is neutral, focusing on technical considerations and advice rather than expressing strong emotions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   For ML tasks involving larger datasets, Polars or DuckDB are better choices than Athena due to Python integration and performance.
    *   Polars is significantly faster than DuckDB for reading Parquet files from S3, with predicate pushdown capabilities.
    *   Consider the frequency of data access, the size of the data, and the need for distributed processing when choosing between Python libraries and Athena.
