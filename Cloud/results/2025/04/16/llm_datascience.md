# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[ [D] Data science is not about... (Score: 368)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1k0c459/data_science_is_not_about/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the relative importance of technical skills versus communication and storytelling skills in data science. Many commenters argue that while technical skills are necessary, the ability to communicate findings and influence stakeholders is often more critical for career success.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral with slight positive sentiment, with commenters sharing experiences and opinions in a fairly objective manner, although some express frustration with the perceived overemphasis on soft skills.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Technical skills are a baseline requirement, but communication skills are what truly differentiate successful data scientists.
    *   Storytelling and the ability to present findings to stakeholders are crucial for making an impact in a business setting.
    *   The importance of soft skills is often underestimated, and many technically skilled individuals struggle to advance due to poor communication abilities.

**[Did great in the coding round but still never heard back from the HR (Score: 27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1k0mdr3/did_great_in_the_coding_round_but_still_never/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread revolves around the frustrating experience of passing a coding round in an interview process but not receiving any feedback or further communication from the company ("ghosting"). Commenters share similar experiences and offer possible explanations, such as hiring freezes, internal candidate preference, or simply poor communication practices.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is slightly Negative, reflecting the frustration and disappointment of the original poster and commenters who have experienced similar situations. There is also a sense of resignation to the current job market conditions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Getting "ghosted" after a coding round is a common occurrence and may not reflect on the candidate's performance.
    *   Possible reasons for ghosting include hiring freezes, the position being put on hold, or waiting for other candidates.
    *   The current job market is tough, and companies may be taking advantage of the situation by not providing feedback to candidates.

**[Is TimeSeriesSplit appropriate for purchase propensity prediction?” (Score: 15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1k082ij/is_timeseriessplit_appropriate_for_purchase/)**
*  **Summary:**  This thread discusses the appropriateness of using TimeSeriesSplit for purchase propensity prediction. The conversation centers on the importance of preventing data leakage and accurately simulating the model's performance in a production environment.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with commenters offering technical advice and considerations in an objective manner.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   TimeSeriesSplit is appropriate for simulating the past-future barrier in production and preventing data leakage from long-term trends.
    *   Time-based split is suitable for the problem because when the model is deployed in production, it will be used to predict purchase propensities for quotes received in the future.
    *   Consider alternative methods like random sampling within time periods or using a purged time series split if features have a look-back window to avoid contamination.
