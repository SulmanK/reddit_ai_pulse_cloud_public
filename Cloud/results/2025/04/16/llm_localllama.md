    *   Local search right now is just setting up agents to use the duck duck go search API and praying that you find what you need before they rate limit you
    *   If you're asking about context window, OpenAI's official model page (https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o4-mini) states that it's 200K.

    *   0.7$ /h, not great not terrible. Probably will go down once the novelty runs out. I'm more curious to see where the 6000PROs will be priced and how they perform.
    *   Add a 4090 to the chart and you will realize that the 5090's aren't all that impressive. Besides, availability and price to performance for the 5090's is still abyssmal.
    *   What are they running to get 65K tokens/s? I would like to replicate those results lol.

    *   Yeah, it's multiagent across network with "agent discovery".  If you have looked at OpenAI's swarm, think of it like swarm across network with auto discovery.

**[Advice for coding setup (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k0q1r4/advice_for_coding_setup/)**
*  **Summary:** Asks for advice for coding setup.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Sounds about par for the course for coding with AI lol
    *   You can use Roo Code or Cline extension in VS Code to produce what you want. The problem with local model are they aren't that good for complex stuff.
    *   You need to be the architect standing atop of the AI to direct it.

*  **Summary:** Asks for help getting Whisper API access to OpenWebUI
*  **Emotion:** Positive.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   I would also consider SherpaONNX... alot of good transcription models runnable locally.
    *   I haven't tried it but KoboldCpp supports Whisper via API (/api/extras/transcribe).
    *   Instead of using the "Whisper" dropdown option in Open WebUI use the "OpenAI" one, and change the endpoint to the target machine running a package like this: [https://github.com/matatonic/openedai-whisper](https://github.com/matatonic/openedai-whisper) .
