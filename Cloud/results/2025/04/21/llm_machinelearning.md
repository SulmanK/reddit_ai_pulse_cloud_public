# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Combine XGBoost & GNNs - but how? (Score: 12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1k4cqb4/d_combine_xgboost_gnns_but_how/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses how to combine XGBoost and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).  Suggestions include using GNNs for feature extraction.  The challenges of using stacked models in production are also mentioned.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, reflecting informative and technical discussion.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   GNNs can be used for feature extraction to improve XGBoost performance.
    *   Stacking models in production is generally undesirable.
    *   Node2vec is used for behavior modeling because the order of events often encodes patterns that a naive tabular representation would not capture.
