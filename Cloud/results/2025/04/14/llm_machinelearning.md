# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Distillation is underrated. I replicated GPT-4o's capability in a 14x cheaper model (Score: 58)](https://i.redd.it/zyj7as7ogque1.png)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the use of distillation techniques to create a model with similar capabilities to GPT-4o, but at a lower cost. Users share experiences, ask about specific methods, and debate the practicality and generalizability of such approaches.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is generally Neutral, with users sharing technical information and opinions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Distillation can be a cost-effective way to replicate the capabilities of larger models like GPT-4o.
    *   The generalizability of distilled models is a key concern; they may perform well in specific domains but poorly across diverse data.
    *   Using pre-existing cloud solutions like GPT4o or Gemini with prompt management systems may be more cost-effective than training and maintaining custom models for many professional use cases.

**[[D] What happened to KANs? (Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks) (Score: 41)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jyz2vg/d_what_happened_to_kans_kolmogorovarnold_networks/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the current state of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a relatively new neural network architecture. Users discuss whether KANs have lived up to the initial hype, and their advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional MLPs (Multilayer Perceptrons).
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is primarily Neutral, with some Negative undertones, reflecting skepticism about the practical benefits of KANs.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   KANs haven't consistently outperformed well-designed MLPs, and their longer training times make them less appealing.
    *   KANs may still be useful for explainable AI due to their intuitive visualization.
    *   KANs can be justified in certain specific scenarios, such as in medically relevant data where a small bump in generalization performance is meaningful.
