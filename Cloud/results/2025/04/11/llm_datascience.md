**[/r/kaggle/comments/1jwa7et/predicting_with_anonymous_features_how_and_why/ (Score: 3)](/r/kaggle/comments/1jwa7et/predicting_with_anonymous_features_how_and_why/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses predicting with anonymous features and the reasons for doing so. One commentator mentions that industry ML systems should work with anything a user puts in and therefore the feature name shouldn't matter. Another commentator suggests that anonymity might be for privacy and to prevent bias.
*  **Emotion:** Mostly Neutral, with elements of negativity regarding the nonsensical nature of using salted password hashes for machine learning.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Anonymous features are useful for building robust, automated systems in industry.
    *   Anonymity can be a privacy measure, though its specific applications are unclear.
    *   Using anonymous features encourages unbiased data analysis, avoiding assumptions based on pre-existing knowledge.

**[Causal Inference Casework (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1jwlf3f/causal_inference_casework/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread is a discussion on the applications and considerations of causal inference, particularly in the context of demand forecasting. The overall sentiment leans towards the importance of understanding the underlying problem and the limitations of causal inference as a direct replacement for forecasting.
*  **Emotion:** The overall tone is cautiously positive, with a focus on providing guidance and raising potential pitfalls.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Causal inference is not always necessary for demand forecasting.
    *   Causal inference requires strong domain knowledge and can be brittle if assumptions are wrong.
    *   Juniors may lack the statistical grounding or domain context to drive a methodological shift to causal inference.
