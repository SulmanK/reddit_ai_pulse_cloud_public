*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  It seems to me that the model very often misses details in the text (by the way, one of the strongest qualities of Google models). Overall not bad, but compared to 2.0 there is not much progress in quality, except for additional censorship.

**[Gemini 2.5 Coding (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1k1j5n1/gemini_25_coding/)**
*  **Summary:** Users are discussing the importance of context, memory, documentation, linters, typecheckers, and tests for models.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  Without context, models cannot intuit well. You need a memory bank or documentation. The larger you go the more you'll need. Get a linter, get a typechecker and get tests.
    *  Split your program up into different files and use aider. You can restrict aider to only work on specific files. Usually it will listen if you ask it to only work on a specific function too.

**[My personal criteria for "Is it conscious yet?" (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1k1kt3h/my_personal_criteria_for_is_it_conscious_yet/)**
*  **Summary:** Users are discussing the criteria for consciousness in AI.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  To be conscious is to have an experience of being. AI is good at simulating that there is something there, but it's just algorithms running on GPUs in a datacenter.
    *  What does consciousness have to do with your criteria?
    *  That would be level 4 of Open AI's personal (what I presume) to be AGI checklist, called "innovators." This does not require consciousness, and even when we get to level 5 when they supposedly can run entire corporations, I doubt we'll have any kind of testing benchmark for this which satisfies either lab researchers or those within the space.
