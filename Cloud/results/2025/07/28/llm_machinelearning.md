    *   GEPA's design leads to significant quality gains with fewer rollouts.
    *   GEPA outperforms GRPO by a considerable margin.
    *   GEPA is effective for prompt optimization and code optimization.

**[[D] AAAI: Not able to update authors (Score: 6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mb92y6/d_aaai_not_able_to_update_authors/)**
*  **Summary:** Users are facing issues with updating author information after abstract submission for AAAI.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Abstract and author fields are locked after abstract submission.
    *   Some users believe the submission deadline was later than expected.
    *   Contacting the conference organizers might help resolve the issue.

**[[R] Misuse of ML for a cortical pain biomarker? (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mbevi4/r_misuse_of_ml_for_a_cortical_pain_biomarker/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses a critique of a paper using ML for cortical pain biomarker, arguing that the analysis is flawed.
*  **Emotion:** Positive
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The criticism is well-founded.
    *   Using an over-engineered model isn't a fatal flaw.
    *   The criticism is fundamental and overturns the whole paper by demonstrating how the data in the paper refute the conclusions asserted in the paper.

**[[D] Shifting Research Directions: Which Deep Learning Domains Will Be Most Impactful in the Next 5–6 Years? (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mbiv33/d_shifting_research_directions_which_deep/)**
