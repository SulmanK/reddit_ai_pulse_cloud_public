    * What's the point of these kinds of posts? This obviously isn't GPT's response outside of prior prompting / custom instructions. Is it supposed to be funny? Genuinely asking.

**[Is Responses API way less capable than ChatGPT(even using the same model, Gpt-4o) (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1m19zu4/is_responses_api_way_less_capable_than/)**

    * They don’t think, don’t reason - buy you think they lie? Lying is a human trait, not a machine trait. AI can, and does, give incorrect information - but that’s not the same as lying.
    * Your post is 5 years old. Ai is no longer hype. You live in the past and are unable to face truth. Ai will crash you like a bug when it's too late. Wake up.
