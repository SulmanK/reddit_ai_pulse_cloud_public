**[When do I really need more than 32GB VRAM? (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1lwgk13/when_do_i_really_need_more_than_32gb_vram/)**

*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * 32GB is already a lot, although nowadays with some video models it's becoming small, lol
    * It's easy to go over 32GB VRAM, and the quality difference between quants and fp16 is understated. More VRAM allows for loading larger, higher-quality models.
    * With the tech evolving so fast right now if your plan is to use this card exclusively for Ai gens then stick to cloud based.
