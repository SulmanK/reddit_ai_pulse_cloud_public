# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[R] Paper Summary: Longman Vocabulary Constraints Reveals New Approach to LLM (Score: 10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ludnqv/r_paper_summary_longman_vocabulary_constraints/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses a paper that proposes using Longman Vocabulary Constraints to improve LLMs. The approach seems to formalize existing intuition.
*  **Emotion:** Predominantly Positive. The comments express interest and appreciation for the approach, describing it as "really cool" and "thoughtful." However, some neutral comments express skepticism and request further information.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The approach is a thoughtful way to formalize existing intuition.
    *   System prompts in LLMs are often "wish-casting" without proper reasoning models.
    *   Constraining the prompt itself may not be as effective as mapping tokens to a smaller vocabulary at the token generation level.

**[Favorite ML paper of 2024? [D] (Score: 9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1luvynh/favorite_ml_paper_of_2024_d/)**
