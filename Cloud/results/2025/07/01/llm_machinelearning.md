# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[R] The Bitter Lesson is coming for Tokenization (Score: 71)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lp1lfb/r_the_bitter_lesson_is_coming_for_tokenization/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion centers on the future of tokenization in machine learning, particularly in light of "The Bitter Lesson." It explores the tradeoffs between efficient tokenization methods (sacrificing niche use cases) and the potential for models to learn tokenization functions jointly with other training. The importance of context window length and its computational cost are also discussed.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with some positive sentiments expressed regarding the quality of the article and associated animations.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Efficient tokenization is crucial for handling large amounts of data and reducing computational costs, even if it means sacrificing some niche use cases.
    * Joint learning of tokenization functions during training might hide complexities but could be beneficial.
    * Tokenization enables embeddings to carry deeper semantic meaning, which transformers then refine based on context.

**[[P] I created an open-source tool to analyze 1.5M medical AI papers on PubMed (Score: 49)](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lozfbp)**
*  **Summary:**  A user introduces an open-source tool designed to analyze a large dataset of medical AI papers from PubMed. The discussion involves comparisons with existing tools like Elicit, inquiries about data acquisition and preprocessing methods, and suggestions for improvement such as linking disease keywords to UMLS IDs. There's also a recognition that classical ML still dominates the clinical space due to explainability and the nature of medical data.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive, with users expressing interest, appreciation, and offering helpful suggestions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The tool offers valuable insights into adoption patterns in medical AI research, going beyond hype around specific architectures.
    * Classical ML methods are still prevalent in clinical applications due to explainability and accessibility for researchers with clinical backgrounds.
    * Linking disease keywords to UMLS IDs and improving the cleaning of the dataset can improve the tool's effectiveness.

**[[D] Any path for a mid career/mid aged MLE to do ML research in the industry (Score: 32)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lotkac/d_any_path_for_a_mid_careermid_aged_mle_to_do_ml/)**
*  **Summary:**  The discussion focuses on providing advice to a mid-career Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) interested in transitioning into a research role in the industry.
