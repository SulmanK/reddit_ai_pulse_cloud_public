**[[D] thoughts about "prompt routing"  - what do you think about it? (Score: 6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m2zrpr/d_thoughts_about_prompt_routing_what_do_you_think/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread is about "prompt routing", a concept where prompts are directed to the most suitable language model. Users discuss the potential benefits, limitations, and existing tools related to prompt routing.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral. While some see potential in prompt routing, the tone is more analytical and pragmatic, discussing its limitations and practicality.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Prompt routing can be useful, but it's heavily dependent on the specific business domain.
    *   Existing tools for prompt routing haven't seen widespread adoption due to various factors like contractual obligations and lack of time/resources in smaller companies.
    *   Prompt routing may become more valuable as the cost per token for language models stabilizes or increases.

**[[D] Liquid neural networks on time series (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m34yq9/d_liquid_neural_networks_on_time_series/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread involves a question about modeling parameterization (theta) over training time in the context of liquid neural networks applied to time series data.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Negative, which likely stems from the user misunderstanding the topic.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Question about modeling parameterization over training time.
