# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[P] MLB random forest with 53%-60% training accuracy. Prediction probability question. (Score: 4)](https://i.redd.it/yo61y0g8zpcf1.jpeg)**
*  **Summary:** The thread is about a user's MLB random forest model and questions about its prediction probability. Other users suggest backtesting it between multiple years to determine if it generalizes well and caution against expecting to beat Vegas odds.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is predominantly Neutral, with a focus on providing objective advice and analysis.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The model's accuracy is likely to vary between years.
    *   Backtesting the model is important to determine its generalization ability.
    *   Beating Vegas odds is extremely difficult, even with a high-accuracy model, due to their margin.
