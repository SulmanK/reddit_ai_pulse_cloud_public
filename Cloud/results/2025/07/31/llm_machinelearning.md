# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Scientific ML: practically relevant OR only an academic exploration? (Score: 43)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mdv2jg/d_scientific_ml_practically_relevant_or_only_an/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the practical relevance of Scientific Machine Learning (ML), particularly Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), and whether it's more of an academic pursuit or truly applicable in real-world scenarios. There are discussions around the limitations of PINNs, the challenges of integrating known physics with flexible models, and comparisons with traditional surrogate modeling techniques. Some users highlight the potential of ML in areas like weather forecasting and drug discovery, contingent on experimental validation.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is generally Neutral. The comments exhibit objective assessments and discussions about the pros and cons of scientific ML, without strong positive or negative emotional expressions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Scientific ML, especially PINNs, faces challenges in real-world applications due to the difficulty of ensuring invariants and the limited improvement when combining known physics with flexible models.
    *   Scientific ML is a rebranding of surrogate modeling and hypersurface-fitting, with many techniques being equivalent to traditional curve-fitting. Key questions to ask include what mathematical terms are being approximated and whether the approximation model is suitable for the application.
    *   ML-based models are showing promise in specific domains like weather forecasting, where they are overtaking physics-based models in accuracy and speed, and potentially in drug discovery, contingent on experimental validation.

**[[D] NeurIPS 2025 rebuttals. (Score: 17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mea5g0/d_neurips_2025_rebuttals/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread is centered around the NeurIPS 2025 rebuttal process. Participants are discussing their experiences with reviewer scores, confidence levels, and the challenges they face in convincing reviewers. Some express frustration with unreasonable reviewer expectations, while others are optimistic about potentially improving their scores with effective rebuttals.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with elements of Neutral and Positive sentiment. There is a sense of anticipation, hope, and slight frustration, reflecting the high-stakes nature of the NeurIPS review process.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   There is hope that well-crafted rebuttals can positively influence reviewers and improve paper scores, but the outcome is uncertain.
    *   Some reviewers are perceived as unreasonable, expecting hyperparameter sweeps or lacking a basic understanding of the field, making it difficult to address their concerns.
    *   Reviewers are often overworked and tired, which may affect their responsiveness and willingness to adjust their scores based on rebuttals.

**[[D] Monthly Who's Hiring and Who wants to be Hired? (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1mdpufm/d_monthly_whos_hiring_and_who_wants_to_be_hired/)**
