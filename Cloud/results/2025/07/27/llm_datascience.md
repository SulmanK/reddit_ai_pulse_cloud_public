**[Can LLMs Reason - I don't know, depends on the definition of reasoning. Denny Zhou - Founder/Lead of Google Deepmind LLM Reasoning Team (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1makoge/can_llms_reason_i_dont_know_depends_on_the/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread revolves around the question of whether LLMs can truly reason. The discussion involves different perspectives on the definition of reasoning and the capabilities of LLMs.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is somewhat negative as the emotion label that occurs the most is Negative.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * LLMs cannot truly reason because they lack the ability to understand causal relationships, as they are trained without this capability.
    * Whether LLMs "truly reason" is less important than their ability to simulate reasoning effectively, suggesting that if the simulation becomes indistinguishable from real reasoning, the definition loses its meaning.
    * The question of whether LLMs can reason is flawed because reasoning exists on a spectrum, is domain-dependent, and humans themselves don't have general reasoning abilities.

**[Hyperparameter and prompt tuning via agentic CLI tools like Claude Code (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1mabzuf/hyperparameter_and_prompt_tuning_via_agentic_cli/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the use of agentic CLI tools like Claude Code for hyperparameter and prompt tuning, with some users sharing their experiences and preferences for manual or semi-manual approaches.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * A semi-manual approach, where the model improves prompts based on mistakes and user feedback, is often faster and more effective than a fully automated approach.
    * Memory MCP setup with a memory graph can be useful in this context.
