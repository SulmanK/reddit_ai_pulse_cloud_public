# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Detailed list of all 44 people in Meta's Superintelligence team. (Score: 300)](https://i.redd.it/40cr7tl2sudf1.png)**
*   **Summary:** The post contains a detailed list of 44 people in Meta's Superintelligence team. Commenters discussed the team's composition, including the lack of hires from Pacific Tech, the dominance of Chinese researchers, and the potential impact of the team's work. Some expressed skepticism about Meta's approach, comparing it to collecting Pokémon and questioning its effectiveness compared to open-source projects.

*   **Emotion:** Predominantly Neutral, with some instances of Positive sentiments. The neutral sentiment reflects factual observations and analytical commentary. Some express hope that Meta fails, and others feel that the team's work will lead to the world falling apart.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The absence of hires from Pacific Tech is notable.
    *   Meta's approach is a vanity project and less effective than open-source initiatives.
    *   Chinese researchers are overrepresented in AI, even among American researchers.

**[Looks like deepmind has also won IMO gold but they haven’t announced it (Score: 112)](https://i.redd.it/8p8x5o4fkvdf1.jpeg)**
*   **Summary:** The post discusses a tweet suggesting that DeepMind has won a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) but hasn't announced it. Commenters express excitement and hope, while some caution against "benchmark hacking." Others inquire about what the IMO is and what P6 refers to. Some argue for focusing on "street smarts" instead of just book smarts.
*   **Emotion:** Predominantly Neutral and Positive. The neutral sentiments are driven by people asking questions and factual confirmations, while positive sentiments reflect excitement and belief in DeepMind's achievement.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   DeepMind winning the IMO gold is exciting news.
    *   It's important to consider whether the achievement is due to "benchmark hacking."
    *   Focus should shift towards "street smarts" and common-sense AI.

**[No one on this subreddit predicted an LLM getting a Gold Medal in the IMO (Score: 66)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1m42n9l/no_one_on_this_subreddit_predicted_an_llm_getting/)**
*   **Summary:** The post questions whether anyone on the subreddit predicted an LLM winning a Gold Medal in the IMO. Commenters debate whether such a prediction was made and discuss the implications of this achievement. Some argue that it was an inevitable outcome, while others point out that the hype is due to it being an LLM-only solution without scaffolding.
*   **Emotion:** Predominantly Neutral and Positive. The neutral sentiments revolve around verifying predictions and discussing the details. The positive sentiments stem from the excitement about the achievement and the acceleration of AI progress.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The achievement was predictable and inevitable.
