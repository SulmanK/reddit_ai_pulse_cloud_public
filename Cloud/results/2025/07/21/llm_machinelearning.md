# Detailed Analysis by Thread

**[[D] Gemini officially achieves gold-medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad (Score: 39)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m5qudf/d_gemini_officially_achieves_goldmedal_standard/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses Gemini's achievement and whether it was expected by ML researchers.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone of the thread is neutral, with users expressing curiosity and amazement.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  User questions if this level of achievement was expected by researchers five years ago.
    *  User questions if OpenAI achieved this several days ago.
    *  User expresses that this is insane and wants to know what LLMs struggle with and why.

**[[D] Is transfer learning and fine-tuning still necessary with modern zero-shot models? (Score: 14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m51kwv/d_is_transfer_learning_and_finetuning_still/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses whether transfer learning and fine-tuning are still relevant with the advent of zero-shot models.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with a combination of positive and negative sentiments. Some users express positive views on the continued importance of transfer learning and fine-tuning, while others express concern about the relevance of older techniques.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  Transfer learning and fine-tuning are still necessary for building real, sustainable products.
    *  Zero-shot models haven't truly eliminated the need for transfer learning as they have been trained on many things already, and we've simply rebranded the problem.
    *  Large generalized models may not perform well enough for business applications, and fine-tuning can improve performance but has downsides.

**[[D] Encoding time series data into images drawbacks (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m5opzo/d_encoding_time_series_data_into_images_drawbacks/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the technique of encoding time series data into images and its potential drawbacks.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with users expressing interest and sharing knowledge.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  User is hearing about this method for the first time and is asking for a paper or article link.
    *  Audio signals are often converted to Mel Spectrograms (frequency / time 2d images) for analysis.
    *  The drawback is how much actual time you can feasibly use due to sampling rate.

**[[R] Reaserch: 3D data and 2D discriminator (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m5rhog/r_reaserch_3d_data_and_2d_discriminator/)**

*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the legal aspects of using copyrighted data for training AI models.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with explanations of legal perspectives.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  Current copyright law does not explicitly ban using copyrighted material as input for training, especially if the output doesn’t directly reproduce the original content.
    *  Companies are being sued and are winning every case because layman understanding was always clearly wrong.
    *  The one to watch right now is NYTimes vs OpenAI.

**[[R] submitting code to conference for verification. (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m5db3x/r_submitting_code_to_conference_for_verification/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses whether conferences require code submissions for verification.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  Most conferences don't require you to submit code/weights unless you're working on a benchmarking paper.
    *  If you just took existing methods/models and only finetuned them, it'll most likely get rejected on the grounds of novelty.
