    *   Gemini solved the math problems end-to-end in natural language (English).

**[It's still pretty cool, but the details matter (Score: 244)](https://i.redd.it/sx36yimpm9ef1.png)**
*  **Summary:** This thread explores the nuances of AI achievements, particularly regarding training data and methodologies, in light of Gemini's performance at the IMO. Users discuss whether training on past problems diminishes the accomplishment and compare it to how humans prepare for such contests.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with both positive acknowledgment of the achievement and negative skepticism regarding the methods used.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Providing the model with high-quality solutions and hints diminishes the accomplishment compared to a general model solving the problems without specific training.
    *   Training on previous problems is a normal way to prepare for the IMO, so Gemini's approach is reasonable.
    *   It's important to consider whether the model used external tools or had access to solutions during the test, as this would affect its level of learning and problem-solving ability.

**[OpenAI researcher on deepmind’s IMO gold (Score: 166)](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m5qfqu)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around an OpenAI researcher's comments on DeepMind's Gemini achieving gold at the IMO, sparking debate about training methods and comparability of results. Users discuss the lack of transparency from OpenAI and the potential for Goodhart's Law to affect benchmarks.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is largely neutral, with some hints of positive and negative sentiment. The comments convey a sense of skepticism and concern about the way AI performance is evaluated and compared.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   DeepMind's training methods for Gemini, including providing access to high-quality solutions, may not be directly comparable to OpenAI's approach.
    *   There's a lack of transparency from both OpenAI and DeepMind regarding the specific training methods and prompts used, making it difficult to evaluate their results.
    *   Training AI models specifically for benchmarks like the IMO may lead to Goodhart's Law, where the benchmark becomes less meaningful as a measure of general intelligence.
