# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Wouldn't be the first time I've seen an entire org propped up by a 80MB Excel file (Score: 174)](https://i.redd.it/19xz40qp79ef1.png)**
*   **Summary:**  The thread discusses the reliance of organizations on large Excel files for crucial operations, touching on version control issues, data governance, and the knowledge gap regarding data warehouse solutions.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a hint of humor and sarcasm related to common data management challenges.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Large Excel files are a common but problematic solution for data management in some organizations.
    *   Version control for these files is often inadequate (e.g., using "USE_THIS_ONE" naming conventions).
    *   Data governance can be informal and rely on individual knowledge.

**[Data Snooping Resources (Score: 8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1m5i5dj/data_snooping_resources/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses resources related to "data snooping," also known as p-hacking or dredging. It emphasizes that exploring data for interesting patterns is acceptable as long as appropriate multiple comparison corrections are applied.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is positive, encouraging exploration and proper statistical practices.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Exploring data for interesting findings is acceptable.
    *   Multiple comparison corrections are essential when performing data snooping.
    *   The commenter is looking for references to support the advice.

**[Maintenance of clustered data over time (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1m5m5pn/maintenance_of_clustered_data_over_time/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses strategies for maintaining clustered data over time. Suggestions include using similarity matching for daily updates and periodically running a full re-cluster to address data drift. The importance of versioning clusters is highlighted for data lineage.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral and informative, focusing on practical solutions.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Clustering should be treated as semi-static with periodic refreshing.
    *   Daily ETLs should use similarity matching to existing cluster centroids.
    *   Clusters should be versioned to maintain data lineage when significant shifts occur.
