# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[P] Chess Llama - Training a tiny Llama model to play chess (Score: 4)](https://lazy-guy.github.io/blog/chessllama/)**
*  **Summary:**  Discussion about training a small Llama model for playing chess, with users sharing their experiences and observations.
*  **Emotion:** Overall, the emotional tone is positive due to users finding the project "really cool" and "pretty good".
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The model is impressive considering its small size (23 million parameters).
    *   The model is good but has some weaknesses in the endgame.
    *   A user took advantage of a mistake the model made.

**[[P] Anyone interested in adding their fine-tuned / open source models to this benchmark? (Score: 1)](https://i.redd.it/b9mz5z0ik2ef1.png)**
*  **Summary:** A post asking for contributions of fine-tuned or open-source models to a benchmark, with a user suggesting a specific model to add.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Request for open-source models to be added to the benchmark.
    *   Suggestion to add the UIGEN-X-8B model.

**[[R] 3 backprop vs 1 backprop for gan discriminator training (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m4af9i/r_3_backprop_vs_1_backprop_for_gan_discriminator/)**
*  **Summary:** Discussion on whether to use 3 backpropagation steps versus 1 for training a GAN discriminator, with considerations for 3D data and potential impacts on performance.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Multiple discriminator steps per epoch are initially better than a single step.
    *   Summing all the losses would negatively impact performance.

**[[D] Set of sequences input for transformers (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m4n0ps/d_set_of_sequences_input_for_transformers/)**
*  **Summary:** Discussion about how to input sets of sequences into transformer models, including ideas for positional embeddings and handling order-independence.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Repeating positional embeddings might provide semantics, but an "id" of the item might be needed.
    *   Without position embedding, a transformer will do an order-less analysis.
    *   If the sets do not need to interact, pass them as different batches.

**[[P] Cannot for the life of me get accurate outputs from whisperx (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m4he8v/p_cannot_for_the_life_of_me_get_accurate_outputs/)**
*  **Summary:** A user is asking for help in getting accurate outputs from whisperx, and other users are giving alternative suggestions.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Question about which GPU the user is using.
    *   Suggestion to use Parakeet for transcription.
    *   Speech is speech, and it's best to find a way to record channels separately, transcribe the channel, then mix the other at the end if you want.

**[[D] Why do ML PhD students at top schools/labs stay in the program or 5+ years rather than drop out and go to industry? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m4w3ar/d_why_do_ml_phd_students_at_top_schoolslabs_stay/)**
*  **Summary:** Discussion about why ML PhD students at top schools stay for 5+ years, rather than dropping out.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   People stay in the program for 5+ years when they haven't been able to produce enough research to leave yet.
    *   Mastering out isn't easy and a PhD gives you access to academic jobs you can't get with a master's.
    *   People pursue a PhD to learn to do research, and to get a credential that indicates to future employers that they have this skill.
