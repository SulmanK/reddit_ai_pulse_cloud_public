# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[Toto: A Foundation Time-Series Model Optimized for Observability Data](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lyo2ac/toto_a_foundation_timeseries_model_optimized_for/) (Score: 27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lyo2ac/toto_a_foundation_timeseries_model_optimized_for/)**
*   **Summary:**  The thread discusses the applications and generalization capabilities of the "Toto" time-series model, with users questioning its practical use cases and performance on diverse datasets beyond Datadog's internal telemetry.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with comments primarily focused on inquiry and seeking clarification.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Users are curious about the specific real-world applications of the Toto model.
    *   There is interest in how well the model generalizes to different types of data, such as sensor or financial data.
    *   One user's initial expectation of the post was related to hardware-based waste elimination data collection.

**[[How much DSA for FAANG+ ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lywh35/how_much_dsa_for_faang/) (Score: 9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lywh35/how_much_dsa_for_faang/)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion centers around the necessary amount of DSA preparation for landing data science or related roles at FAANG+ companies, with varying perspectives on the importance of Leetcode-style problems versus SQL and Pandas skills.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with mostly Neutral and some Positive sentiment. The positive sentiment seems to come from encouragement and agreement on the level of preparedness.  There is also one comment with Negative sentiment related to the community over-optimizing for interviews.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   For ML/DS/MLE roles, Leetcode (Medium and Hard) is necessary.  Internships are the easiest way to get an offer.
    *   250 solved Leetcode problems is considered very good preparation by some.
    *   Leetcode isn't the best approach for data science and ML roles, and SQL/Pandas skills are more relevant; data engineering and SWE roles benefit more from leetcode.

**[[The right questions to find clusters (tangles)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lyciw1/the_right_questions_to_find_clusters_tangles/) (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lyciw1/the_right_questions_to_find_clusters_tangles/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread revolves around identifying relevant questions to cluster or categorize job postings, with suggestions ranging from binary features based on job descriptions to utilizing graph databases.  A contrasting viewpoint criticizes the complexity of the proposed approach and suggests a simpler method.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is primarily Neutral, with some negative feedback on the usefulness and complexity of the original question.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   One viewpoint suggests creating binary True/False features based on job description requirements (e.g., "requires a driver's license").
    *   Another proposes using a graph database to explore and analyze job posting data.
    *   A contrasting perspective argues that the problem is being overcomplicated and recommends a simpler approach of defining fields/columns and labeling them.
