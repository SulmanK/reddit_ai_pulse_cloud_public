*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the choices made in Grok 4's design and their implications, particularly the potential for bias and the impact of Elon Musk's influence on the AI's development.  Several comments focus on the perceived censorship of information from right-wing sources and the overall "anti-woke" agenda.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a slight undercurrent of skepticism and concern regarding bias in AI.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Elon Musk is intentionally biasing Grok 4 to reflect his political views.
    *   The term "woke" is being weaponized to justify censorship of factual information.
    *   There is a risk of AI being used to spread propaganda.

**[AI is destroying universities (Score: 469)](https://i.redd.it/m5efvtx6wlcf1.jpeg)**

*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is largely neutral, with some hints of negativity related to the perceived decline of universities and the value of higher education.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Universities are a failing business model that AI is accelerating the demise of.
    *   AI is making it easier for students to be lazy and get away with learning nothing.
    *   Universities should be more focused on specific interests and passions rather than just being a means to a higher salary.

*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with some disappointment but also some measured optimism and skepticism towards the value of benchmarks.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**

    *   Yeah, for chatbot use it's pretty great, especially at a low temperature.
    *   Impressive that K2 is SOTA at more than coding (for a non-reasoning model) and tool-use, which was impressive enough on its own!
    *   Been a while since I've had this much fun just chatting and creative writing. Opus 4 was my go to but a pro subscription that gets you like 5 generations until it goes on cooldown

*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Scale with friends

**[Models are optimized to answer the first question - force them to ask clarifying questions (Score: 49)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1lyjh99/models_are_optimized_to_answer_the_first_question/)**
*   **Summary:** The conversation is about the way LLMs answer questions and the need to make them ask questions themselves for a more natural interaction.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Models answer best with a single prompt. Ask them to give you the clarifying questions, then add the your responses as additional context into the original prompt and send it to a new chat.
    *   arent senses a way to 'ask questions'? maybe were touching on LLMs needing not just more data, but live data, as in eyes and ears and whatnot. senses
    *   I think this is a big issue for LLMs in general.

**[AI 2027 - we are unprepared (Score: 24)](https://youtu.be/5KVDDfAkRgc?si=1YVCc1Fs7lh6oyno)**
*   **Summary:** Users discuss the likelihood and implications of AI advancements by 2027, reacting to a YouTube video.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The main problem I have with this is that it anthropomorphizes the AI to have a "personal long term goal", as if it has motivations and desires like humans do.
    *   Another 2027 *** AI prediction. The last 2027 video was pretty much China steals this, China steals that and so on. Literally had to click off cause of how many “too-specific” predictions the video / author made which was ridiculous.
    *   I'm starting to understand why many blame the hype, ai won't have any dramatic impact by 2027 and probably not for several years after imho

*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 2 Points of View:**
    *   Georgia gets plenty of rain. It's already build several man-made lakes but it needs more because the population has grown.
    *   This is the Georgia with peaches, not the Georgia with the breakaway republics along the Russian border.

    *   What's the best bet on Robotics-AI-Convergence? Robotics ETFs?
    *   The Image suggesting that he have seen something ?!
    *   So even Figure or Google Robotics can't be considered as the GPT-1 of robotics? The bar is pretty high.

*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Not until the industry figures out ***.
    *   VR is amazing and a glimpse of the future, but the form factor is still terrible. That will have to change significantly before mass adoption.
    *   Currently VR just doesnt work as well as traditional media for narratives. Yes its immersive tech but cinema and TV rely heavily on framing and changing camera angles to set mood.

    *   Anyone who comments things like "after the singularity [confident statement]" doesn't understand what the term means.
    *   It’s most likely less than 1 percent of the world, I don’t know anyone personally who knows about it
    *   For me it’s the inherent fear and hand wringing about it that I don’t relate to.
