# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[P] Hill Space: Neural networks that actually do perfect arithmetic (10⁻¹⁶ precision) (Score: 42)](https://i.redd.it/d2rqnobr8gcf1.png)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion is about the applications of Hill Space and whether it can be applied to any formal rule based system, and if the "Hill space" is the main point of the paper.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, expressing curiosity and analysis.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Questioning the applicability of Hill Space to formal rule-based systems beyond mathematics.
    *   Uncertainty about the significance of Hill Space for general neural networks, but potential usefulness for differentiable programming.
    *   Skepticism regarding the novelty of "Hill space" and its relation to GLU variants.
