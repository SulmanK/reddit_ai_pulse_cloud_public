*   **Summary:** This thread discusses the news that Mark Zuckerberg offered a billion dollars to a dozen people at Mira Murati's startup, and surprisingly, no one accepted. Users speculate on the reasons for this, including loyalty to the startup, dislike of Meta, existing stakes in the startup, or the possibility that the rumor is false.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with some comments expressing negativity towards Meta and some expressing surprise or disbelief at the situation. One comment expresses positivity due to a crush.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The AI researchers believe in the startup's mission and potential, or they dislike Meta.
