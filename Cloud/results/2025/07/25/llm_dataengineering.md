**[Regretting my switch to a consulting firm – need advice from fellow Data Engineers (Score: 40)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m8s3rz/regretting_my_switch_to_a_consulting_firm_need/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread discusses the challenges and regrets some data engineers face after moving to consulting firms, seeking advice on how to navigate the situation.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Negative, with some Neutral and Positive sentiments mixed in. Many comments express dissatisfaction and regret regarding consulting roles.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Consulting firms often prioritize customer relationships and networking over technical skills, leading to shallow work.
    *   Long hours and unrealistic expectations are common in consulting, often due to poor expectation management and overpromising.

**[What's your opinion on star schema approach in Analytics? (Score: 39)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m8vf1g/whats_your_opinion_on_star_schema_approach_in/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread is about the star schema approach in analytics, with people discussing its relevance, advantages, and disadvantages in modern data warehousing.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Positive and Neutral. People are generally positive about the star schema approach but recognize that it "depends on the use case".
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The star schema model was originally created when storage was scarce. Nowadays, storage is cheap, so it's compute that matters.
    *   Strict data modeling standards don't explain slow progress; shifting requirements do.
    *   Over-normalization can hinder analysts and data scientists, so a "gold" layer with denormalized structures can be useful.
