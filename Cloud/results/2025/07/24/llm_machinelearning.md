# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Why is there such a noticeable difference between Stat and CS section of Arxiv? (Score: 12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m7ubmp/d_why_is_there_such_a_noticeable_difference/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread discusses the differences in content between the Statistics and Computer Science sections of Arxiv. Contributors discuss the nature of publications, peer review, and the differing focuses of Statistics and CS in Machine Learning.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with some positive sentiments expressed when describing Machine Learning applications.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Arxiv categories are meaningless and outdated. Applied ML is still ML research if it provides novel insights.
    *   CS encompasses a broader range than just ML models, including computation, optimization, hardware design, etc., while statisticians focus more narrowly on model creation.
    *   A significant portion of ML research in CS is application-focused, while statistics tends to focus on theoretical underpinnings and limitations of models.
