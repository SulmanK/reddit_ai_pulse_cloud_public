**[Are your traditional Data Science projects still getting supported? (Score: 14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1m8da2j/are_your_traditional_data_science_projects_still/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses whether traditional data science projects are still relevant in the current landscape, with some arguing that machine learning is now being rebranded as AI, while others maintain that core ML principles are essential and still profitable.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, reflecting a discussion rather than strong sentiment. However, some comments lean towards a slightly positive view.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Traditional data science is being rebranded as "AI."
    * Machine learning is still essential for pattern recognition and prediction.
    * Projects that generate revenue for companies are always supported, regardless of whether they use "AI" or traditional ML.

**[SHAP values with class weights (Score: 11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1m7qbd9/shap_values_with_class_weights/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread explores the application of SHAP values in machine learning, particularly concerning the impact of class weights when dealing with imbalanced datasets and a negative SHAP values.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Class weighting affects the model and, consequently, SHAP values.
    * Large negative SHAP values can indicate missing features in the positive class of imbalanced data.
    * It's important to consider the impact of class weights on model performance and the interpretation of SHAP values.
