# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[ [D] Is it me or is ECAI really bad this year? (Score: 25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m69wc3/d_is_it_me_or_is_ecai_really_bad_this_year/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the perceived poor quality of the ECAI conference this year.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with some expressions of disappointment or frustration regarding paper rejections and review quality.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The quality of reviews at major conferences, including ECAI, is generally poor.
    *   Experiences of paper rejections with minimal feedback.
    *   Inquiry about AI involvement in the writing or evaluation process of the papers.

**[ [D] Is there anyone using GRPO in their company? (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m6kujc/d_is_there_anyone_using_grpo_in_their_company/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the use of GRPO (presumably a Reinforcement Learning algorithm) in companies, with a focus on its data efficiency and practical applications compared to DPO.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral and informative.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   GRPO is not data efficient and requires access to an online oracle.
    *   DPO is more practical due to the availability of preference data.
    *   Implementing the algorithm is relatively easy using existing libraries.

*  **Summary:** The thread seems to be seeking guidance for a Machine Learning in Quantitative Finance conference.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The user is looking for information about the topic.

**[ [D] OpenAI API for voice agents (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1m62piz/d_openai_api_for_voice_agents/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the OpenAI API for voice agents, its limitations, and potential alternatives using Whisper and TTS.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is primarily neutral, with a hint of negativity regarding the API's quality.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   OpenAI's voice API uses WebRTC for real-time audio streaming, and a link to documentation is provided.
    *   OpenAI's speech-to-speech API is limited, suggesting Whisper and TTS combination or alternative platforms like VAPI or VoiceAIWrapper.
    *   The quality of the API is expected to be poor.
