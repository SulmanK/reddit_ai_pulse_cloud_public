# Detailed Analysis by Thread

**[Let's talk about the elephant in the room (Score: 225)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lvk417/lets_talk_about_the_elephant_in_the_room/)**
*  **Summary:** The post discusses the common issue of recruiters not understanding the nuances of data engineering roles and the similarities between different cloud platforms. It points out that recruiters often focus on specific tools (e.g., Databricks) without realizing that engineers with experience in one cloud platform can often adapt to others (e.g., GCP).
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone of the thread is neutral, with comments expressing annoyance and frustration at recruiters' lack of understanding, as well as offering advice on how to navigate these situations. The sentiment score is high (above 0.6) in most comments but there are some expressing negative emotions,
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Recruiters often lack a deep understanding of data engineering roles and technologies.
    *   Data engineers often have to "dumb down" their experience or even lie to recruiters to fit the job description.
    *   While there are similarities between cloud platforms, some argue that tools like Databricks are not equivalent to full cloud platforms like GCP or AWS, and experience with the latter is more valuable.
