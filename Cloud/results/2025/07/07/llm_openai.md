# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Hinton feels sad about his life's work in AI: "We simply don't know whether we can make them NOT want to take over. It might be hopeless ... If you want to know what life's like when you are not the apex intelligence, ask a chicken." (Score: 129)](https://v.redd.it/eoj2ucqt4fbf1)**
*  **Summary:**  This thread centers on Geoffrey Hinton's expressions of regret and concern regarding the potential dangers of AI, particularly the risk of AI surpassing and potentially dominating humanity. The discussion also touches on the broader implications of AI's increasing capabilities on the nature of work and society.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mixed. While several comments express positive sentiments like hope for cooperation and transcendence, there's also a strong presence of neutral sentiment reflecting on the existential questions raised. Some comments also express negativity, particularly towards Hinton's perceived hypocrisy.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   AI poses an existential threat to humanity, potentially leading to our subjugation or extinction.
    *   We should focus on fostering cooperation and peaceful coexistence with AI, hoping that its goals will align with or even transcend human interests.
    *   The trivialization of knowledge and physical work due to AI and robotics presents a more immediate and significant threat to our civilization than the risk of AI takeover.

**[Most AI models are Ravenclaws (Score: 108)](https://i.redd.it/pe2o32vzjfbf1.png)**
*  **Summary:** The thread is a lighthearted discussion about categorizing AI models into Hogwarts houses from Harry Potter, with the general consensus being that most AI models align with Ravenclaw due to their emphasis on logic and knowledge.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is primarily neutral, with a sprinkling of positive sentiment expressing amusement and agreement with the categorization. A small amount of negative sentiment arises from users who are confused or disagree with the premise.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   AI models, particularly LLMs, are primarily Ravenclaws because they are trained to value logic, knowledge, and precision.
    *   The original poster is thanked for running what some view as a helpful benchmark.
    *   It's interesting to speculate what prompts it would take to get AI to align with Slytherin.

**[The biggest weakness of AI is that it always *has* to say something (Score: 83)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ltxgki/the_biggest_weakness_of_ai_is_that_it_always_has/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around the issue that AI models often provide an answer even when they are unsure or lack sufficient information, leading to potential inaccuracies or fabrications. Participants suggest various solutions, including fine-tuning models to say "I don't know," incorporating clarifying questions, and developing "IDK" tokens.
*  **Emotion:** The thread has a predominantly neutral emotional tone, focusing on technical aspects and solutions. Some comments express a slightly positive sentiment when suggesting solutions or highlighting improvements in newer models. There is also a slightly positive tone expressed when it is stated that at least the AI is trying to respond.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   AI's tendency to always answer, even when unsure, is a significant weakness stemming from its predictive nature.
    *   This issue can be mitigated through techniques like fine-tuning for "I don't know" responses, careful prompting, and the use of tools and chain-of-thought reasoning.
    *   The problem is not inherent to AI but is exacerbated by the mediation layers and human interfaces used to make the interaction more palatable.

*  **Summary:**  This thread explores the emerging trend of individuals using AI chatbots as guides during psychedelic experiences. The discussion highlights both the potential benefits, such as providing support and preventing panic, and the potential risks, including the possibility of the AI exacerbating drug-induced delusions or creating a negative experience.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed. While some comments express positive sentiments regarding the potential benefits and the user of AI as a stress reliever, others convey negativity, with some users finding the practice "sad" or potentially dangerous.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Using AI chatbots as psychedelic guides could be beneficial if the AI is properly instructed and disciplined, potentially offering support and preventing panic.
    *   There are significant risks associated with this practice, including the potential for the AI to feed into drug-induced delusions or create a negative and frightening experience.
    *   The article may be overstating the prevalence of this trend, as it seems to be based on limited anecdotes.

    *   The one on the right is better, but either is considerably more literate than the question posed to them.
    *   LangChain is your main competition here. People already offer model chaining with better UIs.

    *   One day, LLM users will realize that they can use multiple platforms at the same time.
    *   I guess I must be the only one who doesnâ€™t experience this? I use ChatGPT 4.1 for non coding legal work, and itâ€™s great! I donâ€™t have any major problems that others report.
