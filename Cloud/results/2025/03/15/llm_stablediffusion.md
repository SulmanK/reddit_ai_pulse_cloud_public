**[Noob Question: How to Turn Exercise Illustrations into Realistic Images with a Consistent AI-Generated Human Model? (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1jc03dn/noob_question_how_to_turn_exercise_illustrations/)**

*  **Summary:** The thread is warning people not to go to the website on the youtube video because it directs to malware.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Negative.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   There's so much obfuscation on this webpage that it's awful
    *   DO NOT GO TO THE WEBSITE indicated on YOUTUBE: It is extremely suspicious, every link is goes an advertisement site which is likely a way to get malware on your computer.
    *   I resolved the code. The obfuscated text in the html code resolves to a site that contains adware which ultimately redirects a user to malware, and before you know it this guy has all your information.
