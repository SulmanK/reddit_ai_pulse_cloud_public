*   **Summary:** A user is asking for resources on score-based generative models, and another user suggests Song's presentation and blog, which provide conceptual explanations and visualizations.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral (Sentiment Score: 0.7297985553741455)
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Looking for resources to learn about score-based generative models.
    *   Suggesting Song's presentation and blog as good introductory materials.
    *   Highlighting the conceptual nature and visualizations in the suggested resources.

**[[D] Seeking Advice on Fine-tuning QWQ-32B Model (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jfev1c/d_seeking_advice_on_finetuning_qwq32b_model/)**
*   **Summary:** A user is seeking advice on fine-tuning a QWQ-32B model, with responses covering the use of ChatML tags, the impact on reasoning output, and the suitability of QLoRA for fine-tuning.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral (Sentiment Score: 0.846314549446106)
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Using ChatML tags may cause a loss of reasoning output format
    *   The necessity of thinking depends on whether a reasoning model is desired or not
    *   QLoRA works with QWQ-32B and can be used with shorter context length on a single GPU.

**[[D] Improving Large-Context LLM calls with filter LLMs (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jfiowc/d_improving_largecontext_llm_calls_with_filter/)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion revolves around improving large-context LLM calls by using filter LLMs and the suggestion that document chunking is crucial for effective RAG systems. The technique mentioned is considered "reranking."
*   **Emotion:** Negative (Sentiment Score: 0.7399343252182007)
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Document chunking is important for effective RAG systems.
    *   The described technique is called "reranking."
    *   The user may not be splitting their texts small enough initially, which hinders the reranker's effectiveness.

**[ðŸ¤–ðŸ“ˆ Can AI Really Predict the Markets? I Put It to the Test. [P] (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jfjk1t/can_ai_really_predict_the_markets_i_put_it_to_the/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread questions the ability of AI/LLMs to accurately predict the stock market. The initial post is perceived as similar to LinkedIn content. Other opinions include skepticism due to LLMs' inability to perform math, and the complex prediction loop AI would need to manage when predicting against itself.
*   **Emotion:** Negative (Sentiment Score: varied - 0.7773513197898865, 0.4246612787246704, 0.36822715401649475)
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The post is out of place, resembling a LinkedIn post.
    *   LLMs are unlikely to effectively predict the stock market due to their limitations, such as an inability to do math.
    *   AI predicting the market creates a complex prediction loop where AIs must predict each other's predictions.
