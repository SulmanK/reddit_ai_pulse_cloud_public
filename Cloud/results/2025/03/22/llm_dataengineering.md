**["vibe coding" how do we feel about that as data engineers (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jhc3fk/vibe_coding_how_do_we_feel_about_that_as_data/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread explores the concept of "vibe coding" (using AI to generate code) and its implications for data engineers.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Positive.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * "Vibe coding" is bad. After reviewing an LLM's output, a person should not copy and paste code until it meets some functional requirement.
    * The biggest advantage of vibe coding is the pace at which I am able to now learn new frameworks.
    * I believe vibe coding refers to people who have no idea what they're doing, asking LLM for stuff, and pasting code until it eventually meets some functional requirement. It is, generally a bad/*** thing to do.
