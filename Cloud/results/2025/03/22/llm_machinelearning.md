# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[R]Can AI remember irreversibly, like a brain does? (Score: 155)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jh6lr0/researchcan_ai_remember_irreversibly_like_a_brain/)**
*  **Summary:**  The author built a model that tries to remember irreversibly like a brain and the results are surprisingly well. The discussion focuses on the capabilities and limitations of the model, comparing it to transformers and discussing its potential impact on long-term planning and world understanding. Computational neuroscience insights and the relevance of irreversibility in artificial minds are also discussed.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is primarily neutral. Some comments express positive sentiment, such as "Very cool!" and "great work!", but the overall tone is objective and analytical.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The question of whether the model enables any capabilities that transformers don't already have.
    * Memory is not a learned parameter in the brain, but rather recalling memory itself is a Bayesian process.
    * The idea that rigid irreversibility feels a bit at odds with neural plasticity.

**[[D] Are GNNs obsolete because of transformers? (Score: 69)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jgwjjk/d_are_gnns_obsolete_because_of_transformers/)**
*  **Summary:**  Discussion on whether Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are becoming obsolete due to the rise of Transformers. The conversation explores the strengths and weaknesses of both architectures, noting that GNNs excel in capturing structure in specialized domains like cheminformatics and molecular modeling, while Transformers are more flexible due to language models.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mainly neutral, with a hint of positivity when discussing the usefulness of GNNs in specific applications.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * GNNs are not obsolete; they capture structure that Transformers cannot.
    * Transformers are GNNs on a fully connected graph of tokens.
    * GNNs are the most useful models for molecular modeling.

**[[R] A Survey of Efficient Reasoning Approaches for Large Language Models: Reducing Computational Overhead in Chain-of-Thought Methods (Score: 8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jh2y7e/r_a_survey_of_efficient_reasoning_approaches_for/)**
*  **Summary:**  Discussion on the efficiency of reasoning approaches for large language models, focusing on reducing computational overhead in Chain-of-Thought methods.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is generally positive, with comments praising the work.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Commercial LLMs already use adaptive reasoning strategies based on problem difficulty.
    * Models often reach their best answer before completing full reasoning chains.
    * The average response token length increased linearly with training time and should relate to the difficulty of the prompt.

**[[Research] Peer review process in conferences (Score: 6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jh2gyb/research_peer_review_process_in_conferences/)**
*  **Summary:**  Discussion regarding peer review processes in conferences. Topics include the ethics of reviewers googling papers under review, the amount of time to spend reviewing, and the display of rejected papers in open review systems.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is predominantly neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * It's unethical to google the papers being reviewed.
    * The time spent reviewing a paper depends on the prestige of the conference.
    * Open review systems should not display rejected papers.

**[[D] Looking for applications of ML in the chemical industry. (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jh5ib9/d_looking_for_applications_of_ml_in_the_chemical/)**
*  **Summary:**  Discussion focused on practical and academic applications of Machine Learning in the chemical industry. The lack of publicly available information and the difficulty of transitioning lab discoveries to actual products are highlighted.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is somewhat negative, reflecting the challenges and limitations in applying ML in the chemical industry.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * There's a gap between discovering new compounds and bringing them to market.
    * Most useful research happens in private biotech, where secrecy is extreme.
    * The current gap is probably kind of a problem thatâ€™s come full circle.

**[MyceliumWebServer: running 8 evolutionary fungus nodes locally to train AI models (communication happens via ActivityPub) [P] (Score: 2)](https://makertube.net/w/mLvv7KLoLBJrwTYPfXeSUk)**
*  **Summary:**  A project that combines AI agents with the Fediverse to create a new web for decentralized, federated learning. It uses microservices and ActivityPub for communication.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The idea is to create a new web for AI agents by combining it with the Fediverse.
    * It's a first attempt to realize this. It uses microservices, which communicate over ActivityPub to exchange information about AI models. Nodes are able to leave their learning group and join another.
    * Question about whether the idea is worth pursuing further.

**[[D] on sentiment analysis (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jhap5l/d_on_sentiment_analysis/)**
*  **Summary:**  Discussion on Sentiment analysis.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Sentiment analysis is completely solved.

**[[P] Monitor GPU Utilization (Score: 0)](https://i.redd.it/8or5ocz7l8qe1.png)**
*  **Summary:**  Discussion about monitoring GPU utilization.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * an rtx 4090 at 35 degrees..

**[[D] Advice: How do I become a Reviewer? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jh2bax/d_advice_how_do_i_become_a_reviewer/)**
*  **Summary:**  Discussion about how to become a reviewer.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is positive.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Accumulate adversarial experiences with other reviewers to gain a cynical perspective.
    * How can you have so many publications and not be bombarded with requests to review each year?
    * Both ARR and ACR are conference specific.
