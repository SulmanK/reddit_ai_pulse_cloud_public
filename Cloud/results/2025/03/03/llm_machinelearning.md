# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[R] Had a paper accepted at CVPR, should I put it in arvix first ? (Score: 43)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1j2epr9/r_had_a_paper_accepted_at_cvpr_should_i_put_it_in/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses whether the author should post their accepted CVPR paper on arXiv to increase exposure before the conference, along with a question regarding changes made in the camera-ready version.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive, with expressions of congratulations and encouragement.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Putting the paper on arXiv will lead to more exposure and encourage citations.
    *   It's beneficial to also create a project website or share the code.
    *   It is acceptable to submit the improved version of the paper as the camera-ready version.

**[[D] What is the difference between Machine Learning Engineer roles and Applied Scientist roles where ML is at the core? (Score: 15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1j21zmk/d_what_is_the_difference_between_machine_learning/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion centers around the distinction between Machine Learning Engineer and Applied Scientist roles, especially in the context of companies like Amazon, noting that these roles often overlap and lack standardized definitions.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral and informative.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The terms lack a standardized meaning, and the actual tasks can vary greatly even within the same company.
    *   At Amazon, the title often reflects the interview loop rather than the actual job duties; Applied Scientists get more of both theory and coding related questions.
    *   A simplified view is that MLE roles are more SWE-focused, while Applied Scientist roles are more Data Science-focused.

**[[D] How will the unknown training distribution of open-source models affect the fine-tuning process for enterprises? (Score: 14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1j2cslw/d_how_will_the_unknown_training_distribution_of/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses the potential issues that arise from using open-source models with unknown training data distributions for enterprise fine-tuning, particularly regarding hallucinations and the need for data provenance.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a hint of concern about potential risks.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The unknown training data can lead to unpredictable model behavior and the potential for hallucinations.
    *   A way to develop a zero knowledge proof of some sort that can attribute the training data hashes is needed
    *   Enterprises might standardize on specific models (e.g., Granite as part of Red Hat Enterprise AI).

**[[R] CVPR Reject with 2 accepts and one weak reject (Score: 12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1j2g6vv/r_cvpr_reject_with_2_accepts_and_one_weak_reject/)**
*  **Summary:**  This thread discusses the frustration of having a paper rejected from CVPR despite receiving mostly positive reviews. It delves into the perceived randomness and flaws in the review process, as well as the discretion given to ACs.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is negative, with expressions of frustration and disappointment with the review process.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The review process in ML is often random and noisy.
    *   A single strong rejection can outweigh multiple acceptances, especially if the AC agrees with the rejection.
    *   CVPR switched to mandatory reviewing for qualified people who submit, and it likely added a bunch of noise to the review process from novice reviewers.

**[[D] Feature importance consensus (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1j2g6og/d_feature_importance_consensus/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread is about achieving consensus on feature importance and solving a related problem.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Using their coefficients as a measure of importance is the problem
    *   The user asks what the results would be used for

**[[D] Copyrighted Training Data in EU (Commercial Use) (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1j2g5yq/d_copyrighted_training_data_in_eu_commercial_use/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread seeks advice on using copyrighted training data in the EU for commercial purposes.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive and helpful.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Contact legal counsel or hire an advisor instead of relying on Reddit.
    *   Consider renting GPUs in the United States or another non-EU nation without stringent requirements and conduct your training/data storage there.
    *   Train initially on standard massive public corpus that everyone uses and simply continue training or “fine tune” on your own data

**[[D] What Reinforcement Learning Method Should I Use for Poker AI with LLMs? (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1j2q3q4/d_what_reinforcement_learning_method_should_i_use/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread questions the appropriateness of using LLMs for Poker AI and suggests alternative RL methods.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Using LLMs for this task is not ideal.
    *   Explore techniques like Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization.
    *   You have access to the probs if you just tokenize the action space.
