*  **Summary:** The thread discusses whether companies use both Databricks and Snowflake, and how their architecture looks like.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Some companies use Snowflake as the main data warehouse for analytical and reporting tasks, and Databricks for near real-time processing and ML/AI.
    *   Some use Databricks heavily for ETL and load the final data into Snowflake.
    *   Some use Databricks as blob storage and Snowflake as a data junction.

**[ Now, I know why am I struggling... (Score: 42)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jnuhdm/now_i_know_why_am_i_struggling/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the importance of balancing accuracy with practicality in data reporting, and understanding the needs of the stakeholders.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with instances of Positive, Negative, and Neutral emotions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**

    *   Simpler solutions that are accurate enough to make informed decisions are better than "perfect" solutions that take longer to develop and are harder to maintain.
    *   Sometimes a small difference like 40 cents is important, depending on who the data is for.

**[ Prefect - too expensive? (Score: 37)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jo0001/prefect_too_expensive/)**

*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's better to push the type distinction as far out as possible for lower mental load and better readability.
