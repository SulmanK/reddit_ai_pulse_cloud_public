*   **Summary:** This thread discusses the pros and cons of taking an Individual Contributor (IC) role at a FAANG+ company versus a manager role at a non-tech company, assuming the ultimate goal is to lead people at a large corporation.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone of the thread is neutral. There are variations, including some negative sentiment from those who dislike managing people or receiving unreasonable KPIs, and some positive sentiment from those who think a FAANG IC role is beneficial.
