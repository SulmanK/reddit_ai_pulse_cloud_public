# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Why no mid-teir? I feel like OpenAI is missing a huge potential here. (Score: 301)](https://i.redd.it/0lx5cshuyxpe1.png)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around the absence of a mid-tier pricing option for OpenAI's services, with users debating the value proposition of the existing tiers (Plus and Pro) and suggesting potential reasons and alternatives.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with variations of positive and negative sentiments expressed.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   OpenAI's current pricing structure mirrors the tech industry's common approach of offering inadequate "cheap" options and overly comprehensive "enterprise" options.
    *   ChatGPT Plus is sufficient for most users, making a mid-tier unnecessary given the marginal performance difference with Pro for everyday tasks.
    *   The Pro tier might already be a mid-tier, with even more expensive tiers planned for the future; the $20/month price point may be too high considering free alternatives.

**[GPT 4.5 is severely underrated (Score: 97)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1jgjemq/gpt_45_is_severely_underrated/)**
*  **Summary:** Users discuss the perceived undervaluation of GPT-4.5, highlighting its interactive capabilities, humane feel, and strong performance in writing and instruction following, while acknowledging its higher cost.
*  **Emotion:** Predominantly positive, with users expressing agreement and satisfaction with GPT-4.5's capabilities.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   GPT-4.5 feels more interactive and human-like, excelling as an assistant and in creative tasks compared to models optimized for coding.
    *   The model's cost is a deterrent, leading to it being barely rated or underrated despite its superior performance.
    *   GPT-4.5 demonstrates better adherence to instructions and memory retention, making it feel like working with a superhuman assistant.

*  **Emotion:** Mostly neutral, with some negative sentiment expressing skepticism and concern about AI's potential impact.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Extrapolating AI's success in chess to "everything" is an oversimplification, as chess has a finite and predictable rule set unlike the complexities of real-world problems.
    *   AI hype is driven by commercial interests, and the claims about AI capabilities should be viewed critically.
    *   The fearful reactions to AI threat narratives can inadvertently reinforce those fears as they become training data for future LLMs.
