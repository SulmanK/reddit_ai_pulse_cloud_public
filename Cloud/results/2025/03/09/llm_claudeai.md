# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] The truth about building Hooplog with Claude as "a non-dev with zero coding experience"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1j79efr/the_truth_about_building_hooplog_with_claude_as_a/) (Score: 123)**
*   **Summary:** A user shares their experience building Hooplog, a software application, with Claude, despite having no prior coding experience. The discussion revolves around the impact of AI on software development and the reactions of developers to no-code/low-code solutions.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive, with high sentiment scores across many comments. There's a sense of excitement about the potential of AI to empower non-developers and democratize software creation. There's also a hint of negativity/neutrality stemming from developers who may feel threatened by these changes.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   AI empowers non-developers to build useful software, changing the world and giving individuals control over their digital lives.
    *   Some developers are intimidated by the rise of no-code/low-code solutions and the possibility of non-developers entering the field.
    *   While AI can assist in building basic CRUD apps, a foundational understanding of coding and problem-solving is still valuable.

**[I Finally Tamed 3.7](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1j769w7/i_finally_tamed_37/) (Score: 100)**
*   **Summary:** A user shares their method for effectively using Claude 3.7 by providing context incrementally and instructing it not to write code unless explicitly asked.

*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Claude 3.7 can be effectively "tamed" by providing context in small increments and explicitly instructing it when (and when not) to write code.
    *   Claude 3.7 is frustrating because it often ignores instructions and writes code prematurely.

*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   I think Claude is a better writer than ChatGPT, but ChatGPT has been a more reliable editor. I have found that ChatGPT works incredibly well as a “partner” for projects. Claude works well as the doer in projects. It lacks the personality and boldness that ChatGPT has.
    *   I found it more willing to be critical when I asked Claude to role-play as Gordon Ramsey.
    *   This is interesting because, in my experience, Claude criticizes for the sake of giving criticism. If there are no issues, it will make some up JUST to give criticism because it wants to be diplomatic.
