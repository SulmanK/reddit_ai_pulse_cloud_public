# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[How we built a Modern Data Stack from scratch and reduced our bill by 70% (Score: 124)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1j6zzih/how_we_built_a_modern_data_stack_from_scratch_and/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses a team's experience building a modern data stack from scratch, resulting in a 70% cost reduction.  Commenters offer feedback on the architecture, questioning the cost savings when considering labor, the choice of Kafka, and cloud-neutral strategy.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed. Some comments are positive, praising the effort, while others are negative, questioning the decisions made. Neutral comments provide technical feedback and ask clarifying questions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The new architecture might be over-engineered and not cost-effective when considering labor and maintenance.
    * The cloud-neutral strategy might be causing more pain than it's worth, and committing to a single vendor could be beneficial.
