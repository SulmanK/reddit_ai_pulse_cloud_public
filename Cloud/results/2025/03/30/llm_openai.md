*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Hast du jemals von einer IP-Adresse gehört?
    * GPT tools lassen einiges an interpretationsspielraum im Bezug auf Daten zu. Es ist viel wahrscheinlicher das der Wetterdienst, welcher mutmasslich versehentlich aufgerufen wurde, Deinen Standort anhand von Routingdaten ausgepeilt hat. In diesem Fall hätte chatGPT Deinen Standort nicht notwendigerweise, aber das aufgerufene Tool hätte IP addressen, netzwerk knoten, Cookies und Metadaten um Deine Position geografisch aufzulõsen.
    * Yesterday a product company told me to check if it ships to my city. I'm still creeped out by it.

    * Yeah, maybe not. If it goes by pure logic, it will surely decide we must be eradicated.

*  **Summary:** A user is asking for advice on a job offer from OpenAI, and questioning the ethics of working there.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, however some users express Negative viewpoints on OpenAI and other companies.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * It would be the same as accepting a job offer from Meta. They will increasingly make the same types of commercial implementations. They aren't aligned with ethical AI research anymore.
    * Work for McDonald's, you're peddling overpriced unhealthy junk. Work for Apple you're supporting a company that has a history of forced child labor. Work for Tesla.... Pick your poison, they are all unethical.
    * Did you have these thoughts throughout the interview process?

It really depends on your values. You seem like someone who has deep reservations about this technology already, which makes me think it’s maybe not a great fit for you.
