*  **Summary:** Users discuss the reasons behind the slower generation speed when using the GGUF model with wan2.1. They explain that GGUF models are compressed and need to be decompressed, and they are primarily used to address OOM (Out of Memory) issues rather than to improve speed.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   GGUF models are slower because they are compressed and need to be decompressed.
    *   GGUF models are for those without enough VRAM/space.
    *   If you can run a full model, you don't need GGUF as GGUF will be slower.
