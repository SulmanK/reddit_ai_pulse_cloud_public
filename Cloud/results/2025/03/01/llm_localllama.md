    *   It depends heavily on your domain. If you can digest domain specific document tags with a low size large contenxt model it will improve all downstream tasks.
    *   Fuse01, QwQ, and Qwen2.5 are still my go-tos for docling. I made an interface for myself to switch between models easily.
    *   look into multiagent workflow - because no matter how good your model is, after a certain context length, they drop in performance in regards to the task.

    *   Check that the ollama template for that model is correct and the model supports system messages.
    *   For such permanent "personality" things - check out "Models" in the workspace. Try setting system prompt before sending first message in the chat
    *    When I first installed the Llama3 model I was using it via Terminal. I used /saved  <model> to save a couple of different sessions. So something to do with using /save to save a session prevented the prompt applying OpenWebUI

**[Is This AI PC a Good Deal for $1500? (i7-13700 + RTX 4070 Ti + 32GB DDR5) (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1j0zeht/is_this_ai_pc_a_good_deal_for_1500_i713700_rtx/)**

*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is predominantly negative and neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Awful deal for LLM. A 12100+2x3060 would cost half price and destroy 4070ti+13700.
    *   4070 ti for AI? 5090 for $3k? Nvidia digits? Sorry to say it, but you've been brainwashed by Nvidia.
    *   You would be better off buying something similar without the GPU, and getting a used 3090 instead.

**[Future of LLM (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1j13rf3/future_of_llm/)**
*   **Summary:** Users share their predictions and hopes for the future of Large Language Models (LLMs), with some discussing pre-training data, synthetic datasets, and hardware improvements.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is predominantly positive and neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   As much hate as gpt4.5 got, it still beats 4o in basically every way except cost. llama 4 is going to be better than its predecessor.
    *   As AI learns to optimize for its own training, the amount of time it takes from synthetic data out, to synthetic data in will lessen and lessen until it is virtually instantaneous. Then it will have its own cognitive space and inhabit the world in real time.
    *   Small (< 10b) non-reasoning LLM have plateued. None of the latest 7b LLMs are significantly better than LLama 3.1 8b or Qwen Coder 7b.
