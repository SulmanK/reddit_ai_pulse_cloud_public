**[ [D] What is your cloud setup specs, and how did you setup the environment? (Score: 6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jmlko7/d_what_is_your_cloud_setup_specs_and_how_did_you/)**
*   **Summary:** Users are sharing details about their cloud setups for machine learning tasks.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Runpod.io is a good option with pre-made machine images.
    *   Some users are using multiple A100 GPUs.
    *   The barrier to entry for cloud AI resources has decreased.

**[ [D] Difficulty understanding how DPO is different in VLMs! (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jmf17a/d_difficulty_understanding_how_dpo_is_different/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses the application of DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) in Vision Language Models (VLMs).
*   **Emotion:** Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   DPO is applied to the token output of VLMs.
