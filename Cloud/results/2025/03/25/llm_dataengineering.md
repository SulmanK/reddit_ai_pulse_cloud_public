# Detailed Analysis by Thread

**[[D] Where i work there is no concept about costs optimization (Score: 52)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jiss37/where_i_work_there_is_no_concept_about_costs/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the lack of cost optimization in the OP's workplace, with various comments ranging from accepting it to suggesting ways to address it.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a mix of factual statements and suggestions. There are some positive sentiments expressing that the OP is "lucky".
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Accept the situation if management is okay with it, and focus on other things.
    *   Cost optimization is crucial and should be addressed, even if it means presenting a plan to management later.
    *   Cloud migration can lead to cost savings, but initial lift-and-shift migrations should be followed by optimization efforts.

**[What actually defines a DataFrame? (Score: 26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jiva8y/what_actually_defines_a_dataframe/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread revolves around defining what a DataFrame is, with different users offering their perspectives and interpretations.
*   **Emotion:** The thread's emotional tone is largely neutral, as it's a discussion about a definition. There are some positive sentiments, such as describing dataframes as a place to "frame your data".
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   A DataFrame is a defined object within a given library, like a class with specific methods.
    *   A DataFrame is essentially a 2D array.
    *   A DataFrame is an engineering term without a strictly defined theoretical definition; if it acts like a DataFrame, it probably is one.

**[Do you think Fabric will eventually match the performance of competitors? (Score: 15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jivfi0/do_you_think_fabric_will_eventually_match_the/)**
