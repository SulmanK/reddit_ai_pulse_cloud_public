post_content: [R] Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms
comment_body: I've used Gaussian processes fairly extensively for modelling. I'm curious, have you tried using other methods for approximating the function in question? I've had some issues with GPs scaling, and would be very interested in other's experiences.
comment_summary: User is curious if the author has tried using other methods for approximating the function in question, as they've had some issues with GPs scaling.
