# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[R] Forget Chain-of-Thought reasoning! Introducing Chain-of-Draft: Thinking Faster (and Cheaper) by Writing Less. (Score: 18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jefrb3/r_forget_chainofthought_reasoning_introducing/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses a new approach called "Chain-of-Draft" reasoning, which aims to be faster and cheaper than Chain-of-Thought by writing less. People discuss whether it's fundamentally different from Chain-of-Thought and its potential limitations.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mostly Neutral, with a hint of Positive sentiment.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Chain-of-Draft is just a variation of Chain-of-Thought.
    * The technique's performance might not scale well to more complex problems.
    * Modern LLMs can't easily adhere to arbitrary output limits, which affects this strategy.

**[[D] ICCV 2025 Desk Reject for Appendix in Main Paper – Anyone Else? (Score: 16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jf2rg4/d_iccv_2025_desk_reject_for_appendix_in_main/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses experiences with desk rejections at ICCV 2025 due to including the appendix in the main paper, and whether others have faced similar issues.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, ranging from Negative (frustration) to Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * It's frustrating that there's no verification step for paper formatting.
    * Many conferences require appendices as separate files.
    * This is a common occurrence.

**[[D] Should my dataset be balanced? (Score: 12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jeueo1/d_should_my_dataset_be_balanced/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the question of whether a dataset should be balanced, specifically in the context of a dataset with an 85/15 distribution. Different perspectives are offered regarding when and how to balance a dataset.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is predominantly Neutral, with a slight Negative sentiment expressed in some comments.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Datasets should reflect real-world conditions.
    * Balancing data is generally beneficial for maximizing information gain, especially if you're on a fixed dataset size.
    * Test sets should always maintain the original data distribution.
