# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[I just nuked all our dashboards (Score: 287)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kwiihm/i_just_nuked_all_our_dashboards/)**
*  **Summary:**  A user accidentally dropped all their company's dashboards after receiving questionable advice from ChatGPT. The thread discusses the user's mistake, how to recover, and general best practices for data engineering.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mixed, ranging from amusement and shock to concern and advice. Some comments express disbelief and humor, while others offer practical solutions and words of encouragement. The dominant emotions are likely concern and slight amusement.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The user made a serious mistake that should be reported to management promptly.
    *   Using LLMs without sufficient knowledge and due diligence can lead to disastrous outcomes.
    *   Focus on fixing the immediate problem rather than trying to make broader improvements.

**[Salesforce agrees to buy Informatica for 8 billion (Score: 191)](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/05/27/salesforce-informatica-deal.html)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses Salesforce's acquisition of Informatica. Many users express negative opinions about the deal, questioning its strategic value and potential impact on both companies' customers and products.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is predominantly negative and skeptical. Many comments express disappointment, concern, and distrust regarding the acquisition. Dominant emotions include negativity and skepticism.

    *   The acquisition is a negative development for Informatica and its community, potentially leading to a decline in the product's quality and support, similar to what happened with Tableau after its acquisition by Salesforce.
    *   Salesforce should focus on building better integration tools (SDKs) instead of acquiring companies with outdated technology.
    *   The acquisition is a vendor lock-in play, making it difficult for customers to migrate away from Informatica.

**[DuckLake - a new datalake format from DuckDb (Score: 57)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kwnx2o/ducklake_a_new_datalake_format_from_duckdb/)**
