# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Got laid off today (Score: 215)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kioonm/got_laid_off_today/)**
*  **Summary:** The original poster (OP) was laid off and felt their competence was unfairly attacked. People in the comments offered support and shared similar experiences.
*  **Emotion:** A mix of negative emotions (due to the layoff) and positive emotions (due to the support offered).
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The manager's behavior was unprofessional and uncalled for.
    *   Losing a job can be a blessing in disguise, leading to better opportunities.
    *   The OP should not let the negative feedback impact their confidence.

**[AI is NEVER going to take your job. (Score: 82)](https://dataengineeringcentral.substack.com/p/ai-is-never-going-to-take-your-job)**
*  **Summary:** A discussion about whether AI will replace data engineering jobs. Some argue that AI lacks the domain knowledge and understanding necessary to fully replace humans.
*  **Emotion:** Mostly neutral, with a hint of optimism (based on the belief that AI won't replace jobs).
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   AI is based on pattern matching, not true understanding, making it difficult to replace roles requiring domain knowledge.
    *   The headline "AI is NEVER going to take your job" is click-baity and should be "anytime soon".
    *   Real AI could replace jobs by recreating human intelligence, but current GenAI is not close to that.
