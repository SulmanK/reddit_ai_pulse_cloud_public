    *   I was raised to know the difference between a machine and a person.
    *   No, don't do it. Treat people with respect, and also animals. Treat things like things, unless you want your kids to obey them, and their kids to worship them.
    *   I just say thank you and please because I was raised to do so in conversation and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m having with it, LLM or person or my cat. If it feels natural to you then do it. If it feels weird then donâ€™t. :)
