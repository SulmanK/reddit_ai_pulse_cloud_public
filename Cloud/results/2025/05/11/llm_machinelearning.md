# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] POV: You get this question in your interview. What do you do? (Score: 334)](https://i.redd.it/ysqcirz1m30f1.png)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses how to approach a specific technical question in a machine learning interview, calculating hardware utilization for model training. People are sharing their methods for solving it and commenting on the question's relevance.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with a mix of positive sentiment in some comments expressing confidence in their ability to solve the problem.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Provide the calculation and explain the steps in detail.
    *   Question the practicality and relevance of the question in a real-world scenario.
    *   Suggest the question is more about MLOps than ML itself.

**[[D] What Yann LeCun means here? (Score: 146)](https://i.redd.it/sc6hnya6p50f1.jpeg)**
*   **Summary:** The thread is about Yann LeCun's statement about data usage in humans vs. auto regressive models and their spatial intelligence. People are discussing the quality and amount of data, human sensory experience, and the comparison between text and visual modalities.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is predominantly Neutral. There are some negative sentiments expressed about the arguments.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Humans use less data but have superior spatial and visual intelligence due to real-world sensory experiences.
    *   LLMs are trained on the Internet, which consists of a lot of garbage no human would ever bother to read.
    *   Text is a smaller data source compared to sensory information.

**[[D] What are common qualities of papers at “top-tier” conferences? (Score: 16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1kk62xl/d_what_are_common_qualities_of_papers_at_toptier/)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion revolves around what makes a research paper successful at top-tier machine learning conferences. Key factors include writing quality, methodology, results analysis, addressing limitations, literature review, relevance to the conference scope, targeting community trends and code availability.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Positive.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Excellent writing, clear methodology, and results analysis.
    *   Hot subjects and useless theorems can create a "woah" effect.
    *   Target the community trends and mimic the writing style.

**[[D] NeurIPS Abstract Deadline (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1kk02x7/d_neurips_abstract_deadline/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses whether one can edit the abstract until the paper submission deadline and if the author list can be changed, concluding that you can edit the abstract, but the changes shouldn't be substantial, and you can only change the order of the author list, not the author list itself.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Abstract can be edited until paper submission.
    *   Edits should not be substantial.
    *   You can't change the author list, just the order.

**[Exploring a New Hierarchical Swarm Optimization Model: Multiple Teams, Managers, and Meta-Memory for Faster and More Robust Convergence [D] (Score: 6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1kjtudr/exploring_a_new_hierarchical_swarm_optimization/)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion is on the details of a new hierarchical swarm optimization model, focusing on the roles of agents, team managers, and a global supervisor, along with their communication protocols and adaptive behavior.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The optimization model depends on what information is passed down to the lowest level optimizers.
    *   Managers track which regions were explored and monitor which agents are stuck.
    *   Global supervisors maintain a global memory map.

**[AI Learns to Drive a Car with Gran Turismo [R] (Deep Reinforcement Learning) (Score: 4)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=xOxU0KWJRsE&si=1Wh1q5t3nAlVQKfX)**
