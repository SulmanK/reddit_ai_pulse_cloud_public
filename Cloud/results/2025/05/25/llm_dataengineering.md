# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[ [D] My databricks exam got suspended (Score: 114)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kuwzs9/my_databricks_exam_got_suspended/)**
*  **Summary:**  A user's Databricks exam was suspended, possibly for closing their eyes, leading to a discussion about the strictness and silliness of online proctoring for certifications.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with some negativity and positivity expressed.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The proctoring rules are excessively strict and unreasonable, even preventing candidates from closing their eyes.
    * Databricks should allow exams to be taken at physical test centers to avoid proctoring issues.
    * The value of these exams are questionable when they are just testing if you can memorize the documentation.

**[Career Move: Switching from Databricks/Spark to Snowflake/Dbt (Score: 95)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kuq56n/career_move_switching_from_databricksspark_to/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the decision of switching from Databricks/Spark to Snowflake/dbt for a data engineering career.  It covers the pros and cons of each technology stack and the potential impact on the engineer's role and skillset.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mostly Neutral, with some posts expressing positive sentiment towards Snowflake/dbt and others expressing negative sentiment or concern about the change.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Switching to Snowflake/dbt is a good career move as it aligns with industry trends and offers opportunities to expand one's skillset.
    * The switch might lead to a more SQL-centric role, potentially distancing the engineer from infrastructure aspects they are used to with Spark.
    * Consider the responsibilities of the new role (maintaining the Snowflake instance, handling data ingestion) to determine if it is still rooted in data engineering.

**[How many data model daily (Score: 17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kut02f/how_many_data_model_daily/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread explores whether the number of data models built daily is a meaningful metric or KPI for data engineers.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone leans negative, with many users expressing that it is not a good KPI.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Counting data models is a meaningless KPI, similar to counting lines of code.
    * Data modeling frequency depends on project needs and business stakeholder input, making a daily count irrelevant.
    * Better KPIs include data quality resolution time, data quality issues reaching end-users, and data platform uptime.

**[DE in Financial Industry career path (Score: 16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kux14t/de_in_financial_industry_career_path/)**

**[Dealing with the idea that ERP will solve all business problem (Score: 8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kv5bvz/dealing_with_the_idea_that_erp_will_solve_all/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion centers around how to manage the expectation that an ERP system will solve all business problems and the realization that analytics capabilities of ERPs are often inadequate.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mostly neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * One approach is malicious compliance, giving them exactly what they want to prove the ERP's limitations. The other approach is to fight the idea.
    * You won't convince them until after they try and fail. Then your next CIO/CTO will come in with a data lake or data mesh to fix the mess the last guy left behind.
    * ERPs may need to be supplemented with other systems to provide adequate analytic capabilities.
