Users share their experiences of being obsessed with generating images and videos, experimenting with prompts, and the feeling of constant experimentation for the perfect preset.
*  **Emotion:** Predominantly Positive, with some Neutral sentiments. While the initial question implies a negative concern about addiction, the responses are mixed with humor and acceptance. The overall tone is lighthearted, even while acknowledging the potential for obsessive behavior.

*  **Summary:** The thread seeks advice on voice cloning in specific languages.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Use f5 tts using sloth guidance ( if you have enough dataset ) you can train for your own language.
    *   What would be considered enough dataset?

**[Any way to cycle wildcard entries, rather than randomly select? (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kv4pp7/any_way_to_cycle_wildcard_entries_rather_than/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread asks for ways to cycle through wildcard entries in Stable Diffusion instead of random selection.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Tinyterra pack has a node ttN textCycleLine.
    *   A wildcard array Iâ€™m sure there is if not that would be a crazy oversight
    *   In forge you can with dynamic prompt extension

*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Depends which model.
    *   The Dynamic Thresholding for Automatic1111 and ComfyUI extension was useful in Stable Diffusion 1.5 to prevent images from being overcooked and helps with SDXL to a lesser extent.

**[In need of some help - Beginner (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kvb4n7/in_need_of_some_help_beginner/)**

*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the possible reasons why Stable Diffusion models might disappear
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   you probably deleted them accidentally. files don't just vanish. maybe check the windows defender history
    *   Check your recycle bin, also check your antivirus hasn't quarantined them. Do you have multiple installations and you are looking at the wrong one? Or have you done a system restore?

*  **Summary:** The thread discusses issues with installing and enabling extensions on Stable Diffusion Forge UI and suggest the user reforge.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Local or remote GPU like runpod ? Forge block extension install If you use argument --share or --listen Try reforge
    *   "sd-webui" is usually what's referred to as A1111, not Forge. Not all extensions for the former are compatible with the latter. You've found one that isn't.
    *   "Never OOM"  \[Never Out of Memory\] is the feature as implemented in Forge

**[Adding new nodes to a comfy workflow (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kv4q2h/adding_new_nodes_to_a_comfy_workflow/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses how to add new nodes to a Comfy workflow
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   You can drag from one of the connections on a node and it will suggest alternatives that it could connect to.
    *   Just double click on an empty space of the canvas and type the name of the node you want.
    *   To create a snippet, create a workflow or collection of frequently used nodes on a new canvas.

**[RTX Card Second Hand (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kv5nwd/rtx_card_second_hand/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses whether to buy a RTX 3090 or a RTX 5080 as a second hand card.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The moment 5080 runs out of VRAM, 3090 is faster. If you want to play games in addition to proompting, 5080 is probably better variant. If connector doesn't melt ofc, bless Nvidia.
    *   The 3090 is the best card for heavy models such as Flux Dev, WAN 14B, SDXL, SD 1.5, Pixart Sigma, Wan 1.3B etc. The 5080 or 4080 Super is cheaper and faster than the 3090

**[How to insure safety when using extensions? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kv2t05/how_to_insure_safety_when_using_extensions/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses safety measures when using extensions for Stable Diffusion, including running in a docker container.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   If you are unsure of a repo then do not run it blindly. I reccomend running everything in a docker container.
    *   Same as a1111 itself. Read the code. Welcome to opensource
    *   Write a software that does this:

    iterates through your custom nodes folder:
    Extracts every python function
    Runs each python function through an LLM that basically adds the prompt "Does this function look in any way fishy - obfuscated - or in any way like it could potentially be a malware or virus?"
    Profit

**[I hate Hugging Faces (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kv3ibw/i_hate_hugging_faces/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread expresses frustration with Hugging Face due to its complexity for new users, with suggestions for downloading models and understanding the platform.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Some repos on Hugging Face use a different format than ComfyUI or Forge. Sometimes it's confusing to know which safetensors file to pick to run, because there are so many of them.
    *   Hugging face aint a place to look around for .pt or .safetensors models, it is for a storing a model. It is not a mall, it is a warehouse.
    *   You don't need any "git", you can just look for the safetensor files and download them manually. It is a bit more complicated, but not by much. HF was designed for developers and power users, and that's a problem if you are used to Civitai.

**[Which is the best AI Anime Animation Tool out there? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kv8iw8/which_is_the_best_ai_anime_animation_tool_out/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses if there is an AI Anime Animation Tool out there
*   **Emotion:** Negative
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It does not exist. Not even VEO3 can do this. Probably course they finetune on YouTube and real videos, and fine-tuning on anime basically forbidden.
