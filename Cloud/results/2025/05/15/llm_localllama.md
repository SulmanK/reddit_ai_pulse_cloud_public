**[How We Made LLMs Work with Old Systems (Thanks to RAG) (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kndlvp/how_we_made_llms_work_with_old_systems_thanks_to/)**
*   **Summary:** Users are discussing RAG and its limitations.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   If you find the solution to stop LLM's hallucinating, you better sell it. Don't drop existing solutions. Try to make the AI smaller very small tasks and only if you don't have other means to do it.
    *   In a perfect world, we'd have a tiny reasoning model which is perfect at tool calling and pulling details out of the context window provided by a RAG pipeline. In real life, RAG doesn't fix that in real life.
    *   The quality of the response depends a lot on the retrieval pipeline. RAG is great, but models have only so much context before they start hallucinating. You can fine-tune, but it's tricky and you lose provenance.

**[Local models served globally? (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kndvxo/local_models_served_globally/)**
*   **Summary:** Users are discussing serving local models globally.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Llama-server at home, a reverse ssh-tunnel to a cheap VPS exposing it, and locally an Open WebUI container pointing to your VPS endpoint.
    *   VRAM can be 10x faster. When you switch to CPU use you will be slowed down too much.
    *   Tailscale VPN allows you to connect securely, remotely and is easy to set up. My setup is using Open WebUI served through a VPN.

**[I made an interactive source finder - basically, AI SearXNG (Score: 0)](https://github.com/atineiatte/source-finder)**
*   **Summary:** User is announcing the source finder.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Some of you may already have seen my [Deep Research at Home](https://github.com/atineiatte/deep-research-at-home) script - this is a fork of that just for finding sources, see example in README. To use, copy the pipe code into Open WebUI, install dependencies, and you'll need to fill in SEARCH_URL with your own SearXNG instance.

**[What would you run with 128GB RAM instead of 64GB? (Mac) (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1knexzi/what_would_you_run_with_128gb_ram_instead_of_64gb/)**
*   **Summary:** Users are discussing local LLMs and RAM requirements.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   If local LLM is of interest, just go for the max ram. On an already very expensive computer, it is just a little more. Why be sorry when the next model comes, and you realise that you are missing out because you saved a few hundreds USD?
    *   Some LLMs that come to my mind. Depending on your use case the slow PP is not an issue. CommandA in Q5_KM GGUF for generic tasks.(78GB) WizardLM2 8x22B in Q5_KM GGUF for creative Tasks/RP (100GB). I am a fan of q5_km - seems a sweet spot for me.
    *   Nothing, which is why I have a 96GB.  Things change at 256 but I still would want more.  Things are interesting over 300GB.  Many people here will disagree with this.
