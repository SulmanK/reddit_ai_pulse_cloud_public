*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Totally agree. and they should open source Claude 2 series too. those models deserve to be reserved.
    * I want Anthropic to open source 3.5 Sonnet too. Let’s innovate out in the open rather than behind secretive doors.
    * Maybe an older model like 2.0, but still I don;t think many people could run it at home.
