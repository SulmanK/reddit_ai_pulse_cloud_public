# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[New data engineer getting paid more than me, a senior DE (Score: 72)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ktpgcf/new_data_engineer_getting_paid_more_than_me_a/)**
*  **Summary:** The post is about a senior data engineer who is being paid less than a new data engineer, and seeking advice. Commenters generally suggest the original poster should look for a new job or leverage an offer from another company to negotiate a raise. There is consensus that employers are not always loyal and employees need to advocate for their own market value.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is somewhat negative, reflecting frustration and concern about salary discrepancies. However, there's also a sense of empowerment and encouragement to take action.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The OP should look for a new job to increase their salary.
    *   The OP should negotiate a raise with their current employer by leveraging offers from other companies.
    *   Employers are not always loyal, and employees should prioritize their own financial well-being.

**[Senior data Engineer coworker "not comfortable" writing stored procedures and tasks in snowflake? (Score: 42)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ktlg3v/senior_data_engineer_coworker_not_comfortable/)**
*  **Summary:** The post discusses a senior data engineer who is not comfortable writing stored procedures and tasks in Snowflake.
