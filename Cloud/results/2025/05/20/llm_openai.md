**[Why does openai have a "disallow" for microsoft-for-startups in its robots.txt? (Score: 12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1kr7dds/why_does_openai_have_a_disallow_for/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread explores the question of why OpenAI's robots.txt file disallows crawling of the "microsoft-for-startups" path. The discussion centers around the historical partnership between OpenAI and Microsoft, where startups received free API credits through the Microsoft Founders Hub.

*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The robots.txt entry is likely outdated due to the changing partnership between OpenAI and Microsoft.
    *   The "disallow" directive might be to prevent the old page from appearing in search results.
    *   Microsoft-for-startups now provides Azure credits instead of OpenAI API credits, rendering the old partnership obsolete.
