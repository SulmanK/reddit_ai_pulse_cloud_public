**[[D] Over... and over... and over... (Score: 259)](https://i.redd.it/h4bn8lsfsd0f1.png)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion centers around the limitations of current AI models, specifically LLMs, and whether they can achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).  Some users believe LLMs are unlikely to surpass human intelligence, while others focus on the potential for AI to automate tasks and the need for continuous human steering.  There's also discussion around the public perception of AI and how it is evolving.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with a hint of Positive sentiment. While some comments express skepticism, others are optimistic about the potential of AI.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   LLMs are unlikely to translate into AGI and surpass human intelligence.
    *   AI can automate tasks, but it currently lacks the agency to do it on its own, requiring continuous human steering.
