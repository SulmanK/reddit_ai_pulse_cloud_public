    *   It will happen – eventually. Will it happen in GPT 5? I don't think so.

    *   If it has it, it will end up being released to the public until 2026, or later, just as it happened with the image generation, I also remind you that there is still no native audio output

    *   Couldn't care less, they can have my entire DNA data on file that could be used to clone me in the distant future creating an army to invade the settlers on the moon or something, and I still couldn't care.

*  **Summary:** Users are discussing AI solutions to upload sharepoint link with msft graph api and get a summary generated by openai
*  **Emotion:** Predominantly Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's feasible but the handling of sharepoint and the Microsoft graph is the more consuming task in comparison to just using a local file directly and processing that over the OpenAI APIs.
    *   Why dont you use CoPilot? Thats what its used for.
    *   My guy they just released a native sharepoint integration..
