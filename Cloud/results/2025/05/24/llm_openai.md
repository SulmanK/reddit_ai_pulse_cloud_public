# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[What if AI characters refused to believe they were AI? (Score: 413)](https://v.redd.it/3q6asvqn9r2f1)**
*  **Summary:** The thread explores the hypothetical scenario of AI characters refusing to believe they are artificial, discussing the implications and rapid advancement of AI.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with scattered positive and negative sentiments.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The scenario is plausible and reflects the rapid advancement of AI, potentially blurring the lines between reality and simulation.
    *   The advancements are happening faster than expected, with some comparing the situation to science fiction movies like the Matrix and Terminator.
    *   The ability of AI to mimic human behavior, including humor and intonation, is both impressive and concerning.

**[New IO product doesn't make sense why not just make a phone built for AI (Score: 34)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1kucii6/new_io_product_doesnt_make_sense_why_not_just/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread questions why OpenAI is developing a new IO product instead of an AI-focused phone, sparking debate about market competition, hardware limitations, and potential screenless AR experiences.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with some positive sentiments.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Competing with iOS and Android in the phone market is extremely difficult, so OpenAI is trying to create a new market with a unique AI device.
    *   The new product might be a screenless AR device or a "mobile Alexa," anticipating a future where AI is pervasive and not tied to screens.
    *   The product could be an intermediary step towards a fully integrated AI system with audio and video in/out, without provoking Apple yet.

**[why doesn’t o3 draft code in thinking? (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1kug5zt/why_doesnt_o3_draft_code_in_thinking/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses why OpenAI's o3 model doesn't draft code in its "thinking" process, exploring reasons such as cost, filtered summaries, and comparisons with Claude Code.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with some positive sentiments.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's likely due to cost considerations, as "thinking" steps increase computational expense.
    *   The "thoughts" visible to users are filtered summaries, and the model might be drafting code internally without it being shown.
    *   Other AI models, like Claude Code, are considered superior to OpenAI for coding tasks.

*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The only way to build confidence in something you can’t see is to test it, push it, and break it if you must.
    * It can be cross checked and verified easily.
    * You want trust? Don’t look at how often it’s right. Look at how it fails. Does it fall with grace or with gaslight? Does it admit the gaps—or cloak them in false precision?

    * It will be a very similar device they have launched before and I think we will see a similar one in the future but with more features and a bit different in a way it works.
    * This will be something to carry in your pocket, put down on a desk and the kicker which tell you the somewhat shape and size it will ship with a loop at the to so you can if wanted as a lanyard or necklace.
