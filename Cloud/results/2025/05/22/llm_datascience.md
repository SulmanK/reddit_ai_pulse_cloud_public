*   **Summary:** The thread discusses whether the traditional data scientist role is becoming obsolete, with some arguing that it's splitting into more specialized roles like AI/ML Engineer and Data Analyst/BI. The rise of LLMs soaking up resources is also mentioned.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with some instances of negative sentiment expressing concern about job prospects.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The traditional data scientist role is splitting into more specialized roles.
    *   The LLM craze is diverting resources from traditional data science.
    *   Many "traditional" data science roles were never truly data science in the first place, but rather glorified business intelligence.

**["You will help build and deploy scalable solutions... not just prototypes" (Score: 30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ksvnsk/you_will_help_build_and_deploy_scalable_solutions/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread revolves around frustration with job descriptions asking for Data Scientists to build scalable solutions, with many users agreeing that those responsibilities often fall outside the traditional DS role and into SWE/MLE territory.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with a slight leaning towards negative sentiment due to frustration with unrealistic job expectations.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's unrealistic to expect data scientists to be responsible for building and deploying scalable solutions.
    *   Companies often don't know what they really want from a data scientist and use generic job descriptions.
    *   A single generalist is more effective than two specialists that can't iterate independently.
