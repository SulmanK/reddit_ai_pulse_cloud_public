# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[One of the banes of this scene is when something new comes out (Score: 40)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1ks1iot/one_of_the_banes_of_this_scene_is_when_something/)**
*  **Summary:**  Open-source developers are frustrated with the lack of access to high-end hardware. They can't afford the cloud credits to experiment at scale, and the open-source scene is bottlenecked by hardware, mostly thanks to NVIDIAâ€™s pricing and availability.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive, but there is some negative sentiment related to frustrations with hardware limitations.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Open-source development is being held back by the high cost and limited availability of powerful GPUs.
    * Open-source tools are still valuable and can produce excellent results despite resource constraints.
    * Paid platforms have an advantage due to their greater access to resources, not necessarily superior intelligence or skills.

**[Badge Bunny Episode 0 (Score: 18)](https://v.redd.it/deu5h531862f1)**
*  **Summary:** Reactions to a new episode, with some noting its closed-source nature.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.

*  **Summary:** You still need more than 24GB of vram to run it and it's pretty slow but it works. Hopefully somebody will deploy it to HF if they haven't already.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The interface is helpful for those who don't want to use Jupyter.
    * A screenshot of the interface should be included.

*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Use Img2Img with 0.4 - 0.5 denoise and canny controlnet.
    * Fix in low scale.with img to img, then throw into supir.
    * Try using a re-focusing model.
