# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Am I or my *** crazy? - Unknown unknowns. (Score: 65)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1kgsn61/am_i_or_my_pms_crazy_unknown_unknowns/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread revolves around the difficulties of anomaly detection, particularly the debate on whether unsupervised learning can genuinely deliver business value. The original poster (OP) seems to be struggling with the idea of finding actionable events from statistical anomalies.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mostly Neutral, but with undertones of frustration and a hint of positivity, reflecting the different viewpoints and attempts to find solutions.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Anomaly detection should be driven by business logic and domain expertise, not solely by algorithms. If domain experts can't define anomalies, the project is likely to fail.
    *   Unsupervised learning can be valuable, citing fraud detection as an example where anomalous patterns are the primary indicators.
    *   A combined approach of unsupervised learning to identify anomalies, followed by a supervised classifier to filter out meaningful anomalies, might be a good strategy.

**[Anyone else tried of always discussing tech/tools? (Score: 58)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1kgz36l/anyone_else_tried_of_always_discussing_techtools/)**
*   **Summary:**  The thread discusses the user's frustration with the constant focus on new tech/tools in the data science field, with many feeling that these tools are often overhyped and fail to solve underlying problems. Many users agree that core problem-solving and articulation are being overshadowed by tool adoption.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with touches of frustration.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   New tech/tools are often seen as magic bullets that will solve all problems, but they rarely do.
    *   The focus on adopting AI can be misplaced if there isn't a clearly defined problem that AI can solve.
    *   It's important to consider whether existing tools are sufficient before adopting new ones.

**[Is HackerRank/LeetCode a valid way to screen candidates? (Score: 21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1kgzki4/is_hackerrankleetcode_a_valid_way_to_screen/)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion explores the validity of using HackerRank/LeetCode as a screening method for data science candidates. Opinions range from considering it a necessary evil for filtering a large number of applicants to viewing it as an irrelevant measure of actual job skills.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with some Negative undertones.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   LeetCode is a fast and cheap way to filter many applicants, even if it doesn't directly measure job-relevant skills.
    *   LeetCode primarily measures a candidate's willingness to grind and memorize, which might correlate with willingness to do drudgery work but not technical skills.
    *   LeetCode isn't very good and is a waste of time.
