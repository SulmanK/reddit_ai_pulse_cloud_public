**[[D]  CS PhD seeking advice: Limited resources (2x3090), how to target better-tier publications? (Score: 25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1khhzp3/d_cs_phd_seeking_advice_limited_resources_2x3090/)**
*   **Summary:** A CS PhD student with limited resources (2x3090 GPUs) seeks advice on how to target better-tier publications. The discussion involves suggestions for research directions, efficient methods, and alternative compute resources.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with helpful suggestions and discussions dominating the thread. Some comments express surprise or concern about the PhD student's advisor situation, leading to a slightly negative sentiment in those specific replies.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Focus on research areas that require less computational power, such as small LMs, quantization, or evaluation.
    *   Explore biological data analysis, as many datasets are small and can be processed on limited hardware.
    *   Consider applying for ACCESS allocations by the NSF to gain access to more powerful computing resources.

**[[D] Why is RL in the real-world so hard? (Score: 23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1khxhz1/d_why_is_rl_in_the_realworld_so_hard/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the difficulties of applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) in real-world scenarios. Challenges include limited data, exploration constraints, and the complexity of reward function design.
*   **Emotion:** The thread's emotional tone is mostly neutral, revolving around problem-solving and practical considerations. However, there's also a hint of frustration or resignation regarding the limitations of RL in certain situations.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Lack of sufficient data and the inability to explore are major obstacles to successful RL implementation.
    *   The design of the reward function and the adequacy of observations are crucial for RL to learn effectively.
    *   Imitation learning can be a viable alternative, especially when communicating policy decisions to stakeholders.

**[[D] How many epochs I need for LLM fine-tune? (Score: 10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1khjfgb/d_how_many_epochs_i_need_for_llm_finetune/)**

*   **Emotion:** The thread's emotional tone is neutral, revolving around factual information.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Usually training for more than a couple of epochs will cause the LLM to heavily start hallucinating
    *   Epochs in the range of 2-3 are fine. More than that may lead to overfitting.
    *   Use early stopping based on validation metrics to halt training when performance plateaus.
