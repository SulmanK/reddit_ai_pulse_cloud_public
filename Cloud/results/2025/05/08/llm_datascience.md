*  **Emotion:** Predominantly Neutral, with some Negative undertones reflecting frustrations with the profession.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Data quality issues can render even the best data science efforts meaningless.
    *   Unreasonable expectations from sales teams and management can lead to project failures and professional disappointment.
    *   Navigating corporate politics and expectation management are crucial skills for data scientists.

**[This is how I got a (potential) offer revoked: A learning lesson (Score: 80)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1khu4f8/this_is_how_i_got_a_potential_offer_revoked_a/)**
*  **Summary:**  The user shares an experience of having a job offer revoked after negotiating salary, leading to a discussion about appropriate negotiation strategies and possible reasons for the revocation.
*  **Emotion:** Mostly Neutral, with a hint of Positive sentiment offering support and reassurance.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Asking for the upper bound of a salary range during negotiation is normal, especially if not desperate for the job.
    *   The company may have felt like the candidate pulled a "bait and switch" by initially seeming to accept the lower bound, then pushing for more.
    *   The revocation might not be related to the salary negotiation; the company might have hired another candidate or the position was eliminated.
