# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] How chaotic is chaos? How some AI for Science / SciML papers are overstating accuracy claims (Score: 78)](https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/how-chaotic-is-chaos-how-some-ai-for-science-sciml-papers-are-overstating-accuracy-claims/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses a blog post criticizing the overstatement of accuracy claims in AI for Science and SciML papers, particularly concerning chaotic systems. It highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of AI systems in predicting such systems and the need for clear communication of these limitations.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is predominantly positive, with some neutral undertones. There's appreciation for the clear explanation of complex topics and the identification of potentially misleading research practices.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   AI/ML techniques can predict systems at the edge of chaos in an optimal way, but this is often poorly communicated to a lay audience.
    *   There's a rising trend of questionable papers in the AI field, and this post provides an excellent analysis of one type of such "dodginess."
    *   AI systems are likely to always be limited in certain tasks, such as predicting chaotic systems.

**[[D]which way do you like to clean your text? (Score: 28)](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kzyhh5)**
*  **Summary:** The thread revolves around text cleaning techniques, specifically comparing methods like removing stop words and emojis versus using regular expressions (regex). The discussion emphasizes that the best approach depends heavily on the downstream task and the specific needs of the model being used.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, mostly positive to neutral, with discussions leaning towards practical advice and sharing experiences.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Removing stop words and emojis can destroy important semantic information, especially for modern methods like subword tokenization.
    *   Regex can be faster for optimization purposes, especially for column-wise filtering on large datasets.
    *   The specific text cleaning details may not matter as long as the code runs, isn't overly complex, and is readable, based on experience.

**[[R] Scholar not recognising my name in my paper on ArXiv (Score: 14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1l01rsl/r_scholar_not_recognising_my_name_in_my_paper_on/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread is about users discussing issues with Google Scholar not correctly recognizing their names in papers hosted on arXiv or other preprint servers. They share potential causes and solutions.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral, with a hint of frustration related to the problem.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Manually adding the paper to one's Google Scholar profile is a common workaround.
    *   Special characters like hyphens or double quotes in the name can cause recognition problems.
    *   Creating and linking an ORCiD to Google Scholar can help with name recognition.

**[[D]Help! 0.02 AUPRC of my imbalanced dataset (Score: 2)](https://i.redd.it/fhoswcpoj54f1.png)**
*  **Summary:** The thread revolves around a user seeking assistance with a machine learning model that has a very low AUPRC score (0.02) on an imbalanced dataset.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Undersampling the majority class to a 1:2 ratio with the minority class might improve performance.
    *   An AUROC of 0.78 is promising and indicates the model has learned something about the data, performing better than random guessing.
    *   The user needs guidance on how to address the low AUPRC score, which is a common challenge with imbalanced datasets.

**[[P] DL based Equity Closing Price Prediction Model with Test R² :.978 (Score: 0)](https://i.redd.it/ca23660il14f1.jpeg)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses a deep learning model for predicting equity closing prices, with a reported test R-squared of 0.978. Commenters express skepticism, suggesting that the high R-squared might be misleading due to the model simply copying the previous time step's value or computing R2 on prices instead of returns.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is primarily neutral, with a hint of skepticism and concern about the validity of the results.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Computing R-squared on prices instead of returns is a common rookie error, and the focus should be on predicting stock returns (whether the stock goes up or down).
    *   The model's high R-squared might be due to it simply predicting the previous time step's value with some variance, so the R-squared should be calculated against previous time step values.
    *   For accurate results, the model should be tested over a longer period, such as a month, to predict the whole next month.

**[[D] Why is “everyone” switching to ML? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1kzms4m/d_why_is_everyone_switching_to_ml/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses the perceived trend of people switching to machine learning and the underlying reasons. It touches on the hype surrounding AI, the perceived difficulty of ML compared to other fields, and the current state of the job market.
*  **Emotion:** The overall tone is neutral, with elements of both positive and negative sentiment expressed. There's skepticism about the ease of becoming an ML expert and concern about the hype surrounding AI.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Many people believe that being an ML expert simply involves using ".fit()" without understanding the necessary math, statistics, and probability knowledge.
    *   OpenAI's hype is driving the trend, as they are trying to convince people that LLMs are indispensable, leading to people adapting their work to LLM inference.
    *   ML can be more fun, but only the modeling component, as the rest of the work can be a huge pain. Some think it's harder than software engineering due to the math involved.
