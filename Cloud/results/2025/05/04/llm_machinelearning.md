**[[R] Meta: PerceptionLM: Open-Access Data and Models for Detailed Visual Understanding (Score: 11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1kec7yp/r_meta_perceptionlm_openaccess_data_and_models/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses Meta's PerceptionLM, an open-access data and model for visual understanding. It highlights the availability of the model under a "FAIR Noncommercial Research License" and mentions its cool human-labeled QA pairs that checks if the model knows when things happened.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral, focusing on the factual details and potential of the released model.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The model is released under a FAIR Noncommercial Research License.
    *   Video understanding is generally a challenging area.
    *   Meta's approach is cool because of no distillation, QA pairs, and a new benchmark that checks if the model knows when stuff happened.

**[[D] Good overview of distillation approaches from LLMs? (Score: 8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1kech8d/d_good_overview_of_distillation_approaches_from/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses different approaches to distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically mentioning logit-based distillation, sft and hidden states.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral, as it presents factual information and explanations.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   There are three main types of distillation: logit-based, sft (using generated data), and hidden states-based.
    *   Logit-based distillation requires the models to have the same architecture.
    *   Hidden states-based distillation supports different architectures but requires more space.

**[[R] LLM vs Diffusion Models for Image Generation / Multi-Modality (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1kenrvr/r_llm_vs_diffusion_models_for_image_generation/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses and compares the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) versus Diffusion Models for image generation and multi-modality tasks. It also touches upon OpenAI's image generation and the role of language models in text2image diffusion models.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral and inquisitive, as the thread explores the capabilities and differences between these approaches.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Gemini uses Imagen 3, which is a diffusion model. OpenAI claims autoregressive image generation.
    *   Every text2image diffusion model has a language model, with newer models doing significant processing on encoded language tokens.
    *   Proprietary multimodal LLMs are likely using diffusion or variants.
