# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Visa is looking for vibe coders - thoughts? (Score: 151)](https://i.redd.it/gefvhv84qsye1.png)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion centers on a Visa job posting for "vibe coders." People are debating what the term means, whether it's a real role or just HR using buzzwords. Some suggest it involves using AI tools for coding, while others speculate about the required skills, such as Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, as people are mostly observing and analyzing the job posting without strong emotional expressions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The job title "vibe coder" is likely just a buzzword used by HR and may not accurately reflect the actual responsibilities.
    * The role likely involves a programmer able to write "vibe coding" tools, not specifically hiring a "vibe coder" for programming.
    * The job posting may be AI generated.
