# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Partition evolution in iceberg- useful or not? (Score: 19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kedne3/partition_evolution_in_iceberg_useful_or_not/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around the usefulness of partition evolution in Apache Iceberg. Some users believe it's an overly complex approach that might incur performance hits due to multiple partition patterns. Others find it useful for evolving schema/partition over time without rewriting the entire table. An alternative approach of using separate "cold" and "hot" storage tables is also suggested.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is neutral, with users providing technical explanations and suggesting alternatives in a calm and informative manner.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Partition evolution is complex and might lead to performance issues.
    * Partition evolution is useful for schema evolution without full table rewrites.
    * Maintaining separate "cold" and "hot" storage is a more efficient alternative.

**[How much do ML Engineering and Data Engineering overlap in practice? (Score: 14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kenf7n/how_much_do_ml_engineering_and_data_engineering/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion explores the overlap between ML Engineering (MLE) and Data Engineering (DE) roles, particularly in smaller organizations. Participants discuss how MLEs often handle data pipeline work, especially in dysfunctional orgs. Some suggest that DE is a stepping stone to MLE, while others predict that AI-assisted MLEs will diminish the DE role over time.  The complementary skill sets and the split of responsibilities (DE for data integration, MLE for model deployment) are also discussed.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mostly neutral, with a hint of concern/speculation about the future of DE roles.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * MLE and DE roles have significant overlap, especially in smaller companies.
    * DE is sometimes a precursor to becoming an MLE.
    * AI-assisted MLEs might take over DE roles in the future.
