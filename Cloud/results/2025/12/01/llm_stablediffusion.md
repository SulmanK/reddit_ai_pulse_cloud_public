*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with a combination of positive and negative sentiments. There's excitement about Z image but also some concerns about its limitations.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Z image shows promise as a successor to SDXL.
    *   Z image may not be good with LoRA stacking.
    *   Some argue that Flux was the successor to SDXL, and ZIT will succeed Flux.

**[Z-Image-Turbo Prompt Enhancer V3 [FINAL]: Before & After Comparison (Score: 11)](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pbidzf)**
*   **Summary:** Users are discussing Z-Image-Turbo Prompt Enhancer V3. Some find that the workflow is no longer available and others are wondering if they can run a smaller llm locally within comfy.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is negative.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The workflow is no longer available.
    *   Wanting to know if there is a way to run a smaller llm locally within comfy.

**[Do We Know Roughly How Much VRAM Will Be Required for Z Image Base? (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1pbjofv/do_we_know_roughly_how_much_vram_will_be_required/)**
*   **Summary:** Users speculate on the VRAM requirements for the Z Image Base model, with estimates ranging from 6B to 12B.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The VRAM requirement is unknown, and anyone claiming to know is guessing.
    *   It will probably be the same size. Turbo is 6B so base may also be 6B. Worse case scenario...8~12b.
    *   A 3090 should be enough.

*   **Summary:** A user is asking for help installing and setting up Forge Ui/Neo on Linux.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Use the tool [https://github.com/LykosAI/StabilityMatrix](https://github.com/LykosAI/StabilityMatrix) to install forge then change release to neo.

**[Latent Streaming Synthesis AKA long video generation (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1pbitwz/latent_streaming_synthesis_aka_long_video/)**
*   **Summary:** Users discuss the landscape of open-source and closed-source AI models, with a focus on video generation and hardware requirements.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The next big thing will probably be US-dominated. Most of the "next big thing" models are closed-source and need enterprise-class hardware to run. The open-source models Alibaba are doing are smaller and easier to run on consumer hardware and last-gen tech

**[Best way to upscale (or img2img) while preserving a person's face? (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1pbkxzq/best_way_to_upscale_or_img2img_while_preserving_a/)**
*   **Summary:** Users discuss the best way to upscale (or img2img) while preserving a person's face.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   In my opinion there are 2 kinds of upscaling tasks and the best solution depends on which one you're trying to do. Are you trying to turn a *** image into a good image, or trying to turn a good image into a great image?

**[Is there a workflow for Wan 2.2 animate with Sam 3 ? (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1pbkq8k/is_there_a_workflow_for_wan_22_animate_with_sam_3/)**

**[How to create high quality dataset of character for lora training ? (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1pblua9/how_to_create_high_quality_dataset_of_character/)**
*   **Summary:** Users discuss methods and tools for creating high-quality datasets for LoRA training, comparing SDXL training with Kohya to other methods.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   SDXL training with Kohya is the best AI tool for me. For the dataset, I use 40-50 images. I usually create a second style-LoRA - photorealistic images of random people to go with the character LoRA.
    *   Once you have consistent images, you could try running it through Qwen Edit and generating the various images you require with that. There is an easy-to-use workflow for it.

    *   Try regular Flux Loras with Flux 2
    *   Try qwen and wan at full xD

*   **Summary:** Users react to a LoRA test featuring Jenna Ortega, with some cautioning about Reddit's policies on celebrity images.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Good job. It looks like a very good LoRA. Now, consider deleting this post. The Reddit admin bots are kinda touchy about celeb gens.
    *   Let's do a lora exchange. I did one with another celebrity. Send me a private message. Before they delete the post!
    *   First image is the only good one. Image #5 looks like Peter Dinklage

**[Where to check for Loras (Z Image edition) (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1pblmku/where_to_check_for_loras_z_image_edition/)**
*   **Summary:** Users are looking for the best places to find Loras for Z Image.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   [https://civitai.com/models](https://civitai.com/models) and then just set z-image as filter.
    *   Can try huggingface, layout is terrible though. Civitai is the only true model site that gets the new stuff though as everyone uses it as the rest pretty much *** or have very limited librarys.

*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Something like [SeedVR2](https://github.com/numz/ComfyUI-SeedVR2_VideoUpscaler) ([demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ByteDance-Seed/SeedVR2-3B)), [SUPIR](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-SUPIR), or this [Flux upscaler](https://huggingface.co/jasperai/Flux.1-dev-Controlnet-Upscaler) ([demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jasperai/Flux.1-dev-Controlnet-Upscaler)) would work better. They all more specialize at restoration, even though people use them as upscalers.

**[Tried a portrait in SD and the result was off (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1pbieew/tried_a_portrait_in_sd_and_the_result_was_off/)**
*   **Summary:** A user is asking for advice on how to improve portraits in Stable Diffusion.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   SD models are outdated and do not accept references. You need to upscale and use detailers to have detailed images with SD models. At best you could use models like Qwen Image Edit, Flux Kontext and Flux 2 Dev.
