    *   This thread is a monthly job board where people can post if they are hiring or looking to be hired in the field of machine learning.
2.  [[R] : Is it acceptable to contact the editor after rejection if reviewer feedback was inconsistent and scientifically incorrect ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1pbcpog/r_is_it_acceptable_to_contact_the_editor_after/) (Score: 29)
    *   The main topic revolves around whether it's professionally acceptable to contact an editor after a paper rejection, especially if the reviewer feedback is inconsistent or scientifically incorrect.
3.  [[D] LLM Fine-Tuning: CPT on 71M Short Dialectal Tokens (256 Max ***) - How to Ensure Long-Form Generation Later?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1pbang5/d_llm_finetuning_cpt_on_71m_short_dialectal/) (Score: 10)
    *   This thread discusses the challenges of fine-tuning language models (LLMs) on short dialectal tokens and how to ensure they can still generate long-form content later.
4.  [[N] Initial Analysis of OpenReview API Security Incident](https://openreview.net/forum/user%7Cinitial_analysis_of_openreview_api_security_incident) (Score: 6)
    *   This thread discusses the security incident that occurred with the OpenReview API, with users sharing information and insights about the incident's impact.
5.  [[D] Simple Questions Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1pbgjin/d_simple_questions_thread/) (Score: 1)
    *   This thread is for simple questions related to Machine Learning. In this instance, an undergraduate student asks some fairly involved questions related to latent spaces.

# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Monthly Who's Hiring and Who wants to be Hired? (Score: 30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1pb25zo/d_monthly_whos_hiring_and_who_wants_to_be_hired/)**
*   **Summary:** This is a monthly thread where individuals seeking jobs and companies seeking to hire can post relevant information. Specific examples include a data scientist with 4 years of experience looking for a full-time role in Dublin, Ireland, and a senior data scientist seeking contract or part-time consulting work.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, as the posts are informational and transactional in nature.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Job seekers provide details about their experience, skills, and desired job type (full-time, contract, etc.).
    *   Job seekers specify their location preferences and willingness to relocate.
    *   Job seekers highlight their specific areas of expertise within machine learning (e.g., dynamic pricing systems, AI agents).

**[[R] : Is it acceptable to contact the editor after rejection if reviewer feedback was inconsistent and scientifically incorrect ? (Score: 29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1pbcpog/r_is_it_acceptable_to_contact_the_editor_after/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses the ethics and practicality of contacting a journal editor after a paper has been rejected, particularly when the reviewer feedback is perceived as flawed, inconsistent, or scientifically inaccurate.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mixed, with elements of frustration and hope. Some comments express positive sentiment, encouraging the author to contact the editor, while others remain neutral, acknowledging the potential futility of such an action.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It *is* acceptable to contact the editor, as it's part of their job to mediate between authors and reviewers.
    *   Contacting the editor might be worthwhile if the rejection was a "reject with encouragement to resubmit," but a waste of time if it was a straight rejection.
    *   Reviewers may be using LLMs, making the peer review process less reliable.

**[[D] LLM Fine-Tuning: CPT on 71M Short Dialectal Tokens (256 Max ***) - How to Ensure Long-Form Generation Later? (Score: 10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1pbang5/d_llm_finetuning_cpt_on_71m_short_dialectal/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread addresses the problem of maintaining long-form generation capabilities in language models after fine-tuning them on short dialectal tokens using Causal Prefix Training (CPT).
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Neutral and analytical.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Fine-tuning on short sequences doesn't necessarily limit long-form generation if the transition to longer sequences is structured properly.
    *   A "warm-up" period with intermediate-length examples during instruction tuning can help the model remember how to use longer context windows.
    *   Careful monitoring of loss curves and adjustment of learning rates are important when switching from short to long sequences.

**[[N] Initial Analysis of OpenReview API Security Incident (Score: 6)](https://openreview.net/forum/user%7Cinitial_analysis_of_openreview_api_security_incident)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses the initial analysis of a security incident affecting the OpenReview API, a platform used for academic peer review.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral and factual.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The information shared is largely already known.
    *   A percentage of papers were leaked.
    *   The incident's impact is likely similar across different conferences.

**[[D] Simple Questions Thread (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1pbgjin/d_simple_questions_thread/)**
*   **Summary:** A student is doing machine learning research and asks a few broad questions regarding the geometry of latent spaces and how model architecture influences the learned latent space.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   How can we measure/qualify the geometry of the latent/encoding space of models?
    *   How does model architecture and optimisation techniques influence this learned latent space?
    *   Is it important to think about the properties of the latent space?
