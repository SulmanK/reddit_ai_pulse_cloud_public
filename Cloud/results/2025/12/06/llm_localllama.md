**[Are MoE models harder to Fine-tune? (Score: 16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pfwu8t/are_moe_models_harder_to_finetune/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread explores the difficulties of fine-tuning Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. Users discuss the high VRAM requirements, inefficiencies in older training methods, and the need for specialized training pipelines to properly balance expert training.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive but with some frustration. Users acknowledge the potential of MoE models but also recognize the challenges in fine-tuning them.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   MoE models require significant VRAM, often 24GB or more, making them difficult to fine-tune on consumer hardware.
    *   Fine-tuning MoE models requires specialized training pipelines to ensure proper balancing of expert training.
    *   While challenging, it is thought to be possible and is becoming more common as hardware improves and training libraries catch up.

**[Best benchmark website (Score: 11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pftdc6/best_benchmark_website/)**

**[Convert Dense into MOE model? (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pfxrv5/convert_dense_into_moe_model/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the feasibility of converting a dense neural network model into a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. The general consensus is that it is not a straightforward process and is generally considered impractical due to architectural differences and training requirements.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive with some skepticism. Users acknowledge that it is possible in theory but is difficult.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Converting a dense model to an MoE model is difficult because the underlying architectures are fundamentally different.
    *   It might be possible to achieve a similar result through techniques like distillation, where a MoE model is trained to mimic the behavior of a dense model.
    *   From a cost perspective, it's generally more efficient to train a MoE model from scratch than to attempt converting an existing dense model.
