# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Use Cases for LLMs in tabular Data Science? (Score: 19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1pe5gbk/use_cases_for_llms_in_tabular_data_science/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread explores different applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tabular data science. Some users suggest using LLMs for feature extraction from unstructured data, while others question their effectiveness compared to traditional methods like boosted trees. There's also mention of a platform that allows creating modeling flows via natural language.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a slight positive leaning due to some comments expressing excitement about new transformer models.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   LLMs can be used for feature engineering by extracting information from unstructured data to enhance tabular classifiers.
    *   LLMs may outperform common methods on datasets with very small sample sizes but are generally not as effective as traditional methods for tabular data.
    *   LLMs are useful for creating platforms where modeling flows can be created via natural language.

**[How to Train Your AI Dragon (Score: 16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1pe0a8r/how_to_train_your_ai_dragon/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses a reinforcement learning project focused on training an AI in a game. The discussion highlights the challenges of reward shaping and emphasizes the significant role humans play in defining the goals and constraints for the AI.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is positive, with users expressing interest in the project and acknowledging its complexities.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Reinforcement learning in games can be a challenging task, especially the part about reward shaping.
    *   The human side of AI development is crucial, as the goals and constraints set by humans greatly influence the agent's behavior.
    *   Gathering human-written examples of "good vs bad" decisions can be helpful for sanity checking how the agent interprets rewards.

**[Best Data Conferences (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1pf4qfx/best_data_conferences/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread is a request for data conference recommendations. Users share suggestions based on specific interests like financial services and analytics, also an app is mentioned that recommends techevents based on user's career role.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mostly positive with users sharing their suggestions.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The best data conferences depend on the specific type of data or industry a person works in.
    *   MeasureCamp events are highly recommended for those in analytics due to their unique "unconference" format.
    *   There is an app called Kure-Cal that recommends tech events based on user's career role.

**[Haskell IS a great language for data science (Score: 0)](https://jcarroll.com.au/2025/12/05/haskell-is-a-great-language-for-data-science/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses reasons why Haskell is not considered a great language for Data Science.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Most companies are not hiring for Haskell for data science positions.
    *   There are fewer resources for Haskell for Data Science compared to R or Python.
    *   No major tech company is developing widely available Data Science/AI tooling in Haskell.

**[Error handling in production code ? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1pdzxpg/error_handling_in_production_code/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses the importance of error handling in production code, especially in data science projects. Users share tips on how to validate inputs, handle exceptions, and structure error handling logic.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral with positive undertones.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Error handling is crucial in production code to prevent pipelines from breaking down.
    *   Validating inputs with libraries like pydantic and pandera is essential to avoid unexpected errors caused by invalid data.
    *   Real production code should have layers of try/except, logging, retries, fallbacks, and alerts.
