# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Model learning selection bias instead of true relationship (Score: 23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1pbpnmz/model_learning_selection_bias_instead_of_true/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around the problem of selection bias in a model that predicts customer renewals based on pricing and offer presentations. Users discuss various approaches to mitigate this bias, including A/B testing, causal inference methods, monotone constraints, and Bayesian models.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral. The comments are mostly factual and analytical, offering advice and suggestions on how to tackle the problem of selection bias.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's likely you won't be able to model your way around this, and will need to do something like A/B testing to randomly present some lapsing customers one set of offers and other lapsing customers different sets to then have the data to train models to optimize retention pricing.
    *   The model is learning the company's selection policy, not the true effect of price. Consider using causal inference methods.
    *   Try using monotonic constraints, like those available in CatBoost or LightGBM, to enforce a desired direction in the model's learning.

**[question about CV role wording (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1pch9cp/question_about_cv_role_wording/)**
*  **Summary:**  The discussion centers on how to best represent one's role on a CV, specifically whether to use "Data Scientist" or "Machine Learning Engineer" when the actual title might be different but the work aligns with MLE responsibilities.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is neutral, conveying opinions about the best approach without strong emotional expressions.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Just put DS, the things you’ve worked on will speak for itself.
    *   It would look a lot worse to call yourself something that isn’t your title and for them to look you up on LinkedIn and see you lied.
    *   It's pointless to call yourself MLE unless you are actually doing the job of an MLE but with a DS title.

*  **Summary:** A user announces the launch of DataSetIQ, a tool for searching and gaining insights from millions of macro datasets, and requests feedback from the data science community.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral. One comment is dismissive, while the other simply asks for a demo.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The commentor can smell the ai slop from a mile away lol
    *   The user is asking for a demo.
