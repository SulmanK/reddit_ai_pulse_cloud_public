*   **Summary:** This thread delves into thoughts on Agentic Coding. The thread covers everything from documentation, optimization, code review, patience, and conceptualization of the project.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is positive, with some comments expressing excitement of Agentic Coding.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Agentic coding makes the code balloon and is like working with a moderately smart junior engineer who is extremely lazy.
    *   If you don't work on a project consistently, and lets say take a breake from it for 2 weeks, its alot harder to get into again to get the full context and overview again of what i did last time and what the next steps are and the overall current state of the project. So its always good to have session reports or something similar at the end of each session(before each clear), that you can read everytime after a break.
    *   Agentic coding is forcing you to apply some baseline best practices to development.
