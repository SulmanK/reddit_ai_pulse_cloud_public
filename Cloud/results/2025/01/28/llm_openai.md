# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[How many humans could write this well? (Score: 96)](https://i.redd.it/a0gfiengvrfe1.png)**
*  **Summary:** This thread revolves around a piece of text, likely AI-generated, and asks whether humans could write it and if it’s of high-quality. There’s a debate on its merits with some claiming it's impressive and others criticizing the substance.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral with some negative sentiment present. While most comments are objective, a few critiques reveal a slightly negative leaning.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Many humans could produce similar text, especially given that AI models are trained on human-written text.
    * The text appears to be well-written at first glance, but lacks substance, potentially being an example of "flowery" language without deeper meaning.
    * The quality of text is not really impressive.

**[Can deep seek browse the internet for realtime answers? (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1icaih9/can_deep_seek_browse_the_internet_for_realtime/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the capability of DeepSeek to access the internet for real-time information. Users are also discussing the UI/UX of the DeepSeek interface.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is generally neutral with some negative sentiment expressed by a user who apologized for their laziness.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Deepseek has the ability to browse the internet, which can be toggled with a button on the UI.

**[DeepSeek r1 requires same hardware to run as OpenAI o1? (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ic8g7g/deepseek_r1_requires_same_hardware_to_run_as/)**
*  **Summary:**  This discussion focuses on the hardware requirements of DeepSeek's R1 model, and how it achieves similar performance to OpenAI’s model using a "mixture of experts" architecture.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral, with a focus on technical explanation rather than emotion.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * DeepSeek's R1 model uses a mixture of experts (MoE) architecture.
    * The MoE architecture allows R1 to achieve similar performance to OpenAI's o1 with less compute.
    * This is achieved by activating only necessary computing resources for tasks.
