# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Why is "knowledge distillation" now suddenly being labelled as theft? (Score: 257)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1idjtta/d_why_is_knowledge_distillation_now_suddenly/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the controversy surrounding knowledge distillation and whether it constitutes theft, particularly in relation to OpenAI's accusations against DeepSeek. The discussion includes opinions on the legal and ethical aspects of this practice.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with some comments expressing skepticism or criticism. The sentiment scores are primarily neutral, however, a comment suggests that it is a negative situation, showing a range of sentiments.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Knowledge distillation is not legally theft, and OpenAI's stance is motivated by their competitive losses.
    * The use of OpenAI's API for training other models violates their terms of service.
    * The term "theft" is used as propaganda to portray DeepSeek negatively.
