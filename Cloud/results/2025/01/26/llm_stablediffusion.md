# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Honest question, in 2025 should I sell my 7900xtx and go Nvidia for stable diffusion? (Score: 19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1ia1djq/honest_question_in_2025_should_i_sell_my_7900xtx/)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion centers around whether an AMD 7900xtx user should switch to an Nvidia GPU for better performance in Stable Diffusion. Users shared their experiences with both brands, focusing on CUDA cores and software support.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mixed, with some negativity around AMD's software support and some positive sentiments towards Nvidia's performance. There are also neutral opinions offering advice.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Nvidia GPUs are generally much better for Stable Diffusion due to CUDA cores and better software support.
    *   AMD cards are "ok" for basic stuff, but have a high chance of issues with updates and are difficult to troubleshoot due to lack of information.
    *   If using Stable Diffusion for work, Nvidia is the preferred choice for stability and speed, but if it is just a hobby, there is no rush to switch from AMD.

**[My Development As An AI Artist (Score: 10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1ia4fn2/my_development_as_an_ai_artist/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the original poster's evolution as an "AI artist," from initially being amazed by the technology, to later trying to express something with their creations. It delves into the definition of art and the role of AI.
*  **Emotion:**  The emotional tone is mixed, with some users expressing positivity and others being critical of the poster. There's a general discussion about the nature of AI art, and the "artist" label.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The poster's claim of being an "artist" using AI is pretentious and that their results are derivative, they need to improve their fundamentals by looking into art history.
    *   The use of AI makes the user a director/producer and not an artist, and that the GPU and tech are the artist.
    *   Users shared their own journey with AI, emphasizing the importance of expression and thinking about what makes an image look like "AI trash".

**[Using SDXl and Neu (https://kingroka.itch.io/neu) to create normal maps with a preview rendered using an glsl shader (Score: 6)](https://v.redd.it/5v792a2xi8fe1)**
