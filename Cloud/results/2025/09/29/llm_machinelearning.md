**[[D] Musicnn embbeding vector and copyright (Score: 10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nsza5n/d_musicnn_embbeding_vector_and_copyright/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread explores the copyright implications of using Musicnn embedding vectors, with discussions about derivative works, generated content, and the importance of legal expertise in the music industry.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive and neutral. There is also an underlying sentiment of uncertainty and risk associated with copyright issues.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Generated output from a model is not automatically considered derivative work.
    *   Copyright issues in music are often decided by the party with the better lawyers.
    *   Using public domain songs can help avoid copyright issues when building music-related databases.

**[[D] isn’t N-gram model a global solution given training data ? (Score: 9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ntbbhd/d_isnt_ngram_model_a_global_solution_given/)**
*   **Summary:** The discussion revolves around whether N-gram models can be considered a "global solution" given training data, comparing them to neural networks in terms of generalization and efficiency.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive and neutral. There is an emphasis on explaining and comparing different models.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   N-gram models can be "global" but lack generalization capabilities.
    *   Neural networks generalize better due to their ability to extract abstract features and interpolate between them.
    *   Neural networks work well at web scale due to their efficient interpolation between learned concepts.
