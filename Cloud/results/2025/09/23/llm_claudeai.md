# Detailed Analysis by Thread

**[What is the point of CLAUDE.md? (Score: 112)](https://i.redd.it/iv427na9mxqf1.jpeg)**
*  **Summary:** The thread explores the purpose and usefulness of the CLAUDE.md file, which is intended to provide context and instructions to the Claude AI model. Some users find it effective, while others report that Claude often ignores it. The discussion includes suggestions on how to format the file and what kind of information to include.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral. Most comments have neutral sentiment scores.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   CLAUDE.md is often ignored by Claude, especially in Claude Code.
    *   CLAUDE.md can be effective if formatted correctly and kept concise. It should contain project information and preferred patterns, not rules.
    *   The Claude.md file is the first thing Claude sees after the system prompt, and Claude is fed the Claude.md file automatically at the start of a session. That is it.

**[How to make Claude fix all of its errors perfectly (Score: 17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1noo3x4/how_to_make_claude_fix_all_of_its_errors_perfectly/)**
*  **Summary:** This thread discusses methods and prompts to improve Claude's ability to fix errors, particularly in coding contexts. Users share their strategies, such as forcing code reviews, writing tests, and using specific commands to ensure thoroughness.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotion is slightly positive, with users sharing tips and expressing interest in trying new approaches. Most comments have neutral sentiment scores.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Forcing Claude to perform code review and write tests after each task helps reduce errors.
    *   Using a slash command `/verify` to prompt Claude to re-evaluate its response against the original request and CLAUDE.md standards can be effective.
    *   Some users still find that Claude requires a lot of bug fixing despite these techniques, and others suggest using a "brainstorm mode" before coding.

**[Built our own coding agent after 6 months. Here’s how it stacks up against Claude Code (Score: 9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1noo3ht/built_our_own_coding_agent_after_6_months_heres/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread features a comparison between a custom-built coding agent and Claude Code. Users discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each, with questions raised about the custom agent's architecture, model usage (GPT-5), and cost-effectiveness.
*  **Emotion:** The overall tone is mixed, with some excitement about the custom agent but also skepticism regarding its claims and practical advantages. A few comments are positive.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Custom-built coding agents can achieve good results with simple edit and terminal tools, but they can be more expensive than Claude Code due to API usage.
    *   There is skepticism regarding the claim of using an on-premise GPT-5 instance without cloud dependency.
    *   Claude and Codex are great because they have a proprietary LLM and can build context layers on session.
