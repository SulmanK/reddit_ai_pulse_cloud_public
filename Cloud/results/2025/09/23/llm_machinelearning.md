*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   **Networking and Referrals are Key:** It's difficult to get selected from online applications alone; referrals and networking are crucial.
    *   **Focus on High-Quality, Real-World Research:** Prioritize solid, industrially-relevant research over chasing marginal improvements on benchmarks.
    *   **Software Skills are Essential:** Possessing strong software skills, including coding and software design, is critical for passing interviews.
