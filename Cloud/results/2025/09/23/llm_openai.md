# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Infinite money glitch (Score: 428)](https://i.redd.it/homgtvp0kxqf1.png)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the concept of an "infinite money glitch" in the context of AI development, particularly regarding investments between companies like Nvidia and OpenAI. Some users seek clarification on how money isn't just being circulated between the same entities. Others explain the idea as hyper-optimization of investment, with each node having monetary incentives, similar to how the economy works in general, and creating economic value. Concerns are raised about this not accounting for real-world expenses and the need for revenue streams.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral. While there's some negativity from users seeking clarification, the majority of comments are informative and explanatory, resulting in a neutral sentiment.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The "infinite money glitch" is a hyper-optimization of investment in the AI pipeline.
    *   This concept is a simplified version of how the economy works in general, where money is not spent just once.
    *   The analysis lacks consideration for real-world expenses like operating costs and employee wages.

**[Why is my usage limit suddenly becomes days instead of every 5 hours? (Score: 166)](https://i.redd.it/hk2uxie5ruqf1.png)**
*  **Summary:** Users are reporting a change in their OpenAI usage limits from a 5-hour window to a limit of several days. Some speculate this is due to OpenAI nearing the end of needing users for training data, while others suggest GPT may be tired after serving many clients. Users express frustration with the change, with some switching to alternative services like Claude. A suggestion is made to use Codex Cloud for virtually unlimited quota. Others suggest using multiple LLMs to divide the workload and generate comprehensive reports.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, though with some negative sentiments related to frustration. While some offer positive suggestions (like using Codex Cloud), the core issue being discussed is a negative user experience.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The change in usage limits is frustrating and impacts productivity.
    *   The change may be due to OpenAI reducing reliance on user data for training.
