*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Claude Pro is not worthy anymore. The number of tokens available was similar to the pro account. The amount of prompts reduced each month.

    *   Claude is worth it despite the outrage lately. It is less forgiving than it used to be, but with light tasks and specific directions in the prompts it will keep the needle moving forward.
