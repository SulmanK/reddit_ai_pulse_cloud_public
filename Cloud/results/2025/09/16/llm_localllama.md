# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Fine-tuning Small Language models/ qwen2.5 0.5 B (Score: 17)](https://i.redd.it/hoplx2colkpf1.png)**
*  **Summary:** This thread centers around the difficulties of using LoRA to teach new knowledge to small language models like qwen2.5 0.5B, suggesting it's better suited for formatting and accurate expression rather than knowledge infusion. It also explores alternative approaches, such as fine-tuning larger models and adjusting hyperparameters.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with some positive sentiment.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   LoRA is not ideal for teaching new knowledge to models, mainly because it trains a small adapter at the end of the LLM, limiting the number of parameters and correct architecture to store the knowledge.
    *   For better results, a larger model should be used.
    *   Epochs should be set in the range of (2-4) is optimal for most use cases.
