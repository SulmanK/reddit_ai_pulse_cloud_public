    * Consider cheaper alternatives like OMSCS and OMSA, which offer similar quality education.
    * Defer the decision, focus on the current job, and potentially leverage tuition benefits from the employer for part-time studies.

**[What is the state-of-the-art prediction performance for the stock market? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nqwcip/what_is_the_stateoftheart_prediction_performance/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the challenges of predicting the stock market, with most agreeing that achieving consistently high accuracy is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Suggestions range from using simpler datasets for time-series forecasting to acknowledging the limitations of even sophisticated models.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mostly Neutral. There are also instances of Positive and Negative sentiments.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Predicting the stock market with high accuracy is generally considered infeasible due to the efficient market hypothesis and inherent unpredictability.
    * Even top research and hedge fund models struggle to consistently exceed 55-60% directional accuracy.
    * Instead of focusing on stock market prediction, consider experimenting with more predictable datasets like retail sales data (e.g., the M5 Forecasting competition on Kaggle).
