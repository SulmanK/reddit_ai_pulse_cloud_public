# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] The organization of NeurIPS Position Papers track is a joke (Score: 88)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ns7rd6/d_the_organization_of_neurips_position_papers/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread revolves around negative experiences with the NeurIPS Position Papers track, citing issues with the review process, low acceptance rates, lack of reviewer discussion, and general waste of time for both reviewers and authors.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Negative, reflecting frustration and disappointment with the NeurIPS Position Papers track.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The acceptance rate of 6% is unacceptably low, making the process a waste of time for everyone involved.
    *   The lack of a rebuttal period and direct discussion with reviewers hinders open discussion.
    *   The NeurIPS conference is becoming increasingly terrible.

**[[P] Built a differentiable parametric curves library for PyTorch (Score: 38)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nsnbep/p_built_a_differentiable_parametric_curves/)**
*  **Summary:** A user shares a new differentiable parametric curves library built for PyTorch. Other users express interest and suggest potential applications, such as nonlinear regression in Pyro, and further spline implementations.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Positive, indicating excitement and interest in the newly released library.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The library sounds helpful for nonlinear regression in Pyro.
    *   The library could benefit from incorporating more spline types, such as those implemented in the nflows library.
    *   The project is considered good and useful.

**[[D] Serving solutions for recsys (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nsiois/d_serving_solutions_for_recsys/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the challenges and complexities of serving solutions for recommendation systems. It highlights the need for custom solutions to meet diverse requirements.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, focusing on the technical aspects and challenges involved.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's difficult to satisfy all requirements for all recommendation systems at once.
    *   Systems have different requirements, such as real-time ranking vs. ranking based on external formulas.
    *   Custom-written solutions are sometimes necessary because existing products make too many assumptions about how items are ranked.

**[Can AI Talk to Animals? Decoding Whale & Elephant Language [D] (Score: 0)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4Cs0QBBLXng&si=PpaieJBjngX1jhrT)**
*  **Summary:** The thread is about a YouTube video discussing whether AI can be used to understand animal languages, specifically whales and elephants, however one user could not get through the video due to its "heavy AI slop" intro.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Negative due to the criticism of the video's intro.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The video's intro is considered "heavy AI slop" and makes it difficult to watch.

**[[D] Machine learning research no longer feels possible for any ordinary individual. It is amazing that this field hasn't collapsed yet. (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nsvdqk/d_machine_learning_research_no_longer_feels/)**
