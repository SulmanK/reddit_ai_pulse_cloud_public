post_content: Relationship between ROC AUC and Gain curve?
comment_body: Yes, for binary classification and if by better you mean better gain capture (area). It boils down to the gain capture being equivalent to the gini coefficient, i.e., equal to 2*AUC - 1.

In some domains, the gains chart is also called the _Cumulative Accuracy Profile_ (CAP) and the gains capture/area the _accuracy ratio_ (AR). [This](https://www.listendata.com/2019/09/gini-cumulative-accuracy-profile-auc.html) and [this post](https://datascienceconfidential.github.io/predictive-models/javascript/2018/04/18/ROC-and-CAP.html) go over the derivations and the above formula, (the former with sample code).
comment_summary: Gains chart is also called the Cumulative Accuracy Profile (CAP) and the gains capture/area is called the Accuracy Ratio (AR).

It's pretty fun and very large. Also, this book is great for learning how to analyze it (i'm not affiliated):

post_content: How do you deal with being the only data scientist in your company?
comment_body: This is a tough situation, and I feel your pain. Here are a few things that have helped me:

1.  **Find allies.** Look for people in other departments who are interested in data and analytics. These people can be your advocates and help you get buy-in for your projects.
2.  **Communicate clearly.** Data science can be complex, so it's important to be able to explain your work in a way that non-technical people can understand.
3.  **Focus on delivering value.** The best way to get people to appreciate data science is to show them how it can help them solve their problems.
comment_summary: Find allies, communicate clearly and focus on delivering value.
