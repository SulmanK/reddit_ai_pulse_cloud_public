# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Database tools and method for tree structured data? (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nfzxy9/database_tools_and_method_for_tree_structured_data/)**
*   **Summary:**  The thread discusses the appropriate tools and methods for managing and searching tree-structured data, specifically in the context of files, scripts, and metadata. Recommendations include using file/object storage, graph databases for metadata, and leveraging search capabilities. The SQL schemasse are not mandatory if your main goal is search and retrieval.

*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The problem is not necessarily a database problem but a file/object storage and metadata management problem.
    *   Graph databases can be used to manage relationships between studies and projects as metadata.
    *   Simple solutions such as sqlite or postgres can be used to start. If fuzzy searching is required, elasticsearch or opensearch can be used to tie the metadata.
