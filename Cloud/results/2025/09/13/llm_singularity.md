# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Demis argues that it’s nonsense to claim current models are "PhD intelligences” (Score: 969)](https://v.redd.it/55p7hljv4wof1)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses Demis's argument against the notion that current AI models possess "PhD level intelligence." Some users agree, pointing out the limitations and flaws in current models, while others express frustration with the hype surrounding AI.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed. While many comments exhibit a neutral sentiment, there are also expressions of positivity from those who agree with Demis, and negativity from those frustrated by the AI hype.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Current AI models are not as intelligent as claimed and should not be compared to PhD-level intelligence.
    * OpenAI's PR system is overly hyped, and people who believe it are naive.
    * Some users believe claims about AI are delusional.

**[Within 40 min codex-cli with GPT-5 high made fully working NES emulator in pure c! (Score: 496)](https://i.redd.it/vhuiper0jtof1.png)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses GPT-5 creating an NES emulator in pure C within 40 minutes. Some users are impressed, while others point out that the model likely leveraged existing open-source implementations and memorized or searched for code rather than truly solving the problem.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is predominantly neutral, with a mix of impressed and skeptical sentiments.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The achievement is impressive, showcasing the potential of AI in coding.
    * The achievement is less groundbreaking because GPT-5 likely relied on existing implementations and didn't truly "solve" the problem from scratch.
    * GPT-5 may have leveraged access to the internet to find existing open-source implementations.
