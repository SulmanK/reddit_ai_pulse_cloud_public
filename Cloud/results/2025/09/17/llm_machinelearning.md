# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] AAAI - phase 1 rejection rate? (Score: 21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nj02du/d_aaai_phase_1_rejection_rate/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the rejection rate of papers in the first phase of the AAAI conference review process, particularly within CV/ML/NLP tracks. Some comments speculate on the acceptance rates, the impact of having fewer than two human reviews, and whether lower rejection rates in phase 1 will correlate with higher rejection rates in phase 2.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, as the discussion primarily involves sharing data and speculations in an objective manner.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The phase 1 rejection rate for CV/ML/NLP papers is around 63-67%.
    *   Papers with less than two human reviews automatically advance to phase 2.
    *   There is speculation about whether a lower phase 1 rejection rate implies a higher phase 2 rejection rate and vice versa.

**[[D] How is IEEE TIP viewed in the CV/AI/ML community? (Score: 18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nj38ur/d_how_is_ieee_tip_viewed_in_the_cvaiml_community/)**
*   **Summary:**  The thread revolves around the perceived value and reputation of the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP) journal within the Computer Vision, AI, and Machine Learning communities, especially in comparison to major conferences like CVPR, ICCV, and NeurIPS.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mixed, with both Neutral and Positive sentiments expressed. Most comments positively regard TIP as a solid journal, but some also acknowledge the greater buzz and visibility associated with top-tier conferences.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   IEEE TIP is considered a top-tier journal with thorough and well-reviewed work, representing solid proof of rigor.
    *   While conferences like CVPR are more hyped and provide faster feedback, TIP offers more depth.
    *   Conferences have significant issues with their reviewing process.

**[[D] How about we review the reviewers? (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1njmxph/d_how_about_we_review_the_reviewers/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the concept of reviewing the reviewers in the academic peer review process. It raises questions about the practical implications and challenges of implementing such a system.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Neutral, with commenters primarily expressing practical considerations and potential challenges.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It is important to have a plan for what happens after identifying problematic reviewers.
    *   Problematic reviewers might not want to review in the first place.
    *   Review IDs for different papers are different making it hard to track a reviewer's performance across papers.

**[[R] Need model/paper/code suggestion for document template extraction (Score: 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1njgjdd/r_need_modelpapercode_suggestion_for_document/)**
*   **Summary:**  The thread is a request for recommendations on models, papers, or code that can be used for document template extraction.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Neutral, consisting mainly of suggestions.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Use spacy for document template extraction.
    *   Try using tesseract OCR and the bounding boxes it generates around the text.
    *   Docling project might be useful.

**[[D] WACV round 1 revised papers for round 2 -- rebuttal guidelines (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nj76ch/d_wacv_round_1_revised_papers_for_round_2/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread is a query about rebuttal guidelines for revised papers in the second round of the WACV conference.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   A user is seeking information about rebuttal guidelines.

**[[D] Need suggestion for Traffic prediction Model (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1njbzj8/d_need_suggestion_for_traffic_prediction_model/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread is a request for suggestions for traffic prediction models.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Positive.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Hybrid temporal-spatial approach is solid for traffic prediction
    *   Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with attention mechanisms are good at capturing spatial relationships between road segments and temporal patterns.
    *   Definitely include time-of-day, day-of-week, and holiday indicators as your basic temporal features
