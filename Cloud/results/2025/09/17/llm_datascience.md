# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Example Take Home Assignment For Interview - Data Science in Finance (Score: 15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1njcvfv/example_take_home_assignment_for_interview_data/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses an example take-home assignment for a data science interview in the finance industry. The primary focus is on determining the optimal model uplift and cutoff values to maximize profit, considering default risk.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The crux of the problem lies in finding the model uplift and cutoff values to maximize profit, even when considering loan defaults.
    *   The choice of algorithm is less important than the ability to find the correct model uplift and cutoff values.
    *   The user was one of the only students who figured this out during their master's program.

**[How do you conduct a power analysis on a causal observational study? (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nj55qy/how_do_you_conduct_a_power_analysis_on_a_causal/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread revolves around the question of how to perform a power analysis on a causal observational study. Various approaches are suggested, including synthetic control methodologies, using programs like G Power, and Monte Carlo simulations. The discussion also touches upon alternative methods to achieve similar goals without a traditional power analysis.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   One approach involves using a synthetic control methodology by artificially adding an effect and running the analysis multiple times to measure variance.
    *   Using a program like G Power can help determine the required sample size based on statistical test type, alpha, 1-beta, and estimated effect size.
    *   Monte Carlo simulation is suggested as a more robust method compared to standard power calculators.
