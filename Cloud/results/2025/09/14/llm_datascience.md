# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Has anyone validated synthetic financial data (Gaussian Copula vs CTGAN) in practice? (Score: 16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ngj3v5/has_anyone_validated_synthetic_financial_data/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the validation of synthetic financial data using Gaussian Copula and CTGAN methods. A key point raised is the potential danger of relying on these methods for macroeconomic data due to the influence of policymakers and the Lucas Critique.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is primarily Neutral, but there is a hint of negativity, arising from the discussion of potential problems related to models, and potentially even a note of warning.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Synthetic data generation methods rely on past statistical relationships, which might not hold true in macroeconomics.
    *   Policymakers' actions can alter underlying economic relationships, rendering past data unreliable for future predictions.
    *   The Lucas Critique suggests that statistical dependence between variables is not fixed.

**[Transitioning from data science to ml engineering (Score: 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ngvcis/transitioning_from_data_science_to_ml_engineering/)**
*   **Summary:** A student is asking for advice on transitioning from data science to machine learning engineering, including what basics to learn and how to approach the transition. Some responses questioned the premise of "transitioning" if the person has never worked as a DS.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mainly Neutral and Positive, with people giving advice and opinions. However, there is also a note of someone who is annoyed that people are using the wrong term.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Focus on getting an internship or entry-level position in either Data Science or ML Engineering.
    *   Get a data science role first, then transition to MLE after gaining experience.
    *   MLE roles in big US companies often require DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms).
