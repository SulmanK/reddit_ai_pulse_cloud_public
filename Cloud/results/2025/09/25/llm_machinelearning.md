**[[R] Summation-Based Transformers: Hybrid Near-Linear Design Matches Full Attention (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nqc5ij/r_summationbased_transformers_hybrid_nearlinear/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses a new Summation-Based Transformer architecture and its potential to replace attention mechanisms, particularly in document classification and multimodal regression tasks. A hybrid approach (summation + attention) is noted for autoregressive language modeling.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Summation-based transformers are different from linear attention mechanisms like Performer because they remove similarity entirely, unlike approximations of the softmax kernel.
    *   Summation alone can be competitive in document classification and multimodal regression.
    *   In autoregressive language modeling, a hybrid transformer architecture (summation in most layers + a final attention layer) performs comparably or better than full attention.

*   **Summary:** A user is seeking opinions on their father's AI-based system that encodes text into optical waveforms, with various comments questioning its novelty and practicality.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Negative, with some neutral viewpoints.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The idea sounds like a convoluted way to describe a QR code.
    *   It is essentially reinventing the wheel, as current Internet communication already uses similar principles.
    *   Software patents are considered dumb.

**[[R] TickBlock: GPT-2-small-level language modeling with just 0.64M params, trained in 12 minutes on a Mac laptop (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nqdj8i/r_tickblock_gpt2smalllevel_language_modeling_with/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses TickBlock, a language model with a small parameter size that can be trained quickly. Commenters express skepticism and request more concrete explanations of the changes made, criticizing the use of jargon and lack of clarity.
*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The pitch seems lofty, and a more concrete explanation of the changes is needed. The learned parameter described seems to be fixed in implementation.
    *   The author should upload a paper to Arxiv and secure a timestamp.
    *   ITT warns about the dangers of vibecoding and advises people to understand their code before sharing it with the world.
