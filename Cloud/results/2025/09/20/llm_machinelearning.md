# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[R] NeurIPS rejected paper resubmission (Score: 27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nkrmzr/r_neurips_rejected_paper_resubmission/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses where to resubmit a paper rejected from NeurIPS, particularly for security-related machine learning work. Suggestions include security-focused conferences like SaTML and top NLP/CV conferences if the work touches on security.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with a slight lean towards Positive sentiment in some comments where users share positive experiences with SaTML. However, there is also some Negative sentiment when considering whether submitting a paper to NeurIPS was a good fit.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   SaTML is a well-regarded, albeit unranked, conference where known researchers submit.
    *   Security work should be submitted to security-focused ML conferences or top NLP/CV conferences if related.
    *   The submitter should consider if their work was a good fit for NeurIPS in the first place.

**[[R] Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens (Score: 25)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01191)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread discusses whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs is a brittle "mirage" that disappears outside the training distribution, or a valuable tool if used correctly as a means to better search embedding spaces.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is primarily Neutral with some Negative sentiment regarding the limitations of CoT.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   CoT is only a mirage if you assume it synthesizes OOD data instead of searching, retrieving, and aggregating information.
    *   CoT is valuable because it aggregates context with useful data.
    *   The "mirage" effect is just current ML in general, and CoT is still valuable when it works.

**[Overcoming accuracy limitations of Analog In-Memory Computing hardware (Score: 23)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09663)**
*  **Summary:** This thread is about overcoming accuracy limitations of Analog In-Memory Computing hardware. Commenters are excited about the possibilities, particularly in real-time LLMs, and discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks.
*  **Emotion:** The thread's emotional tone is generally Positive, with excitement about the technology's potential.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Analog In-Memory Computing hardware is cool and interesting.
    *   It's unclear how long it will take for this technology to appear in consumer hardware.
    *   The noise inherent in analog computing might be beneficial, similar to dropout.

**[[D] Neurips Position Paper Decisions (Score: 21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nlblaw/d_neurips_position_paper_decisions/)**
