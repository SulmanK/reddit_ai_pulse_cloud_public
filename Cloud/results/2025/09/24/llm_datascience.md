# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[Expectations for probability questions in interviews (Score: 12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nphgwl/expectations_for_probability_questions_in/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around a candidate's experience with probability questions in a data science interview. The interviewer preferred a closed-form solution, while the candidate used a simulation-based approach. The conversation includes suggestions for deriving the closed-form solution and understanding the underlying mathematical concepts.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Closed-form solutions are preferable in some interview settings, even if simulation-based approaches are valid.
    *   A strong understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts (e.g., normal distribution, binomial distribution) is expected.
    *   If stakeholders query DBs, bad stakeholders will answer a bunch of questions incorrectly without your knowledge, which could be worse.

**[Ad-hoc questions are the real killer. Curious if others feel this pain (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1npfecr/adhoc_questions_are_the_real_killer_curious_if/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread explores the challenges posed by ad-hoc questions from stakeholders in data science. Some argue that handling such requests is part of the job, while others express concerns about stakeholders independently querying databases and potentially misinterpreting the data.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Negative.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Dealing with ad-hoc questions is a fundamental aspect of a data scientist's role.
    *   Stakeholders should be guided and restricted from independently querying databases to avoid incorrect interpretations.
    *   The difficulty of ad-hoc requests might stem from a lack of domain knowledge.
