**[Why is *** this happening? :D](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nkdi30) (Score: 8)**

*   **Emotion:** Mostly Neutral, with some Negative. Users are confused and frustrated by the unexplained flagging.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The issue is likely a false positive triggered by the phrase "catching a bug," which the safety filters misinterpret.

    *   The user has a ccusage block running in a terminal to track the session length and usage. If the limit is approaching, claude asks claude to summarise the session in a markdown.

**[Super impressed with GPT-5-Codex](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1nkbo7k/super_impressed_with_gpt5codex/) (Score: 0)**
*   **Summary:** A user expresses their preference for GPT-5-Codex over Claude, citing better clarification and database handling.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 1 Points of View:**
    *   GPT-5-Codex is way better at asking for clarification. With Claude I have to remember EVERYTHING in the prompt, it never feels like a two way conversation.

And yes, Claude is awful at checking other files/databases, even in the same conversation it can forget the database structure and just steams ahead with presumptions without telling you…

**[We are only limited by our imagination now](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1nketn5/we_are_only_limited_by_our_imagination_now/) (Score: 0)**

*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The ad is on brand
    *   The users are limited by Claude rate limits and budget.
    *   The ad is nauseating, random stock video clips - super generic, boring, and didn't resonate at all.

**["You're absolutely right!" - Can I get a refund for these tokens?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1nkg4rn/youre_absolutely_right_can_i_get_a_refund_for/) (Score: 0)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses Claude's tendency to agree with users, even when they are wrong.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   it’s like the AI’s trying to be wholesome but ends up just lowkey trolling us all day
    *  “Just make it not make mistakes!” Bro it’s not like the LLM knows you’re wrong but it’s going to gas you up anyways.
    *  Gemini says it too. 100% same.

**[What can Claude Code opus 4.1 do for me?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1nkgio3/what_can_claude_code_opus_41_do_for_me/) (Score: 0)**
*   **Summary:** Users clarify that Claude Code doesn't require the entire codebase to be inputted, but rather looks up code when needed.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 2 Points of View:**
    *  No LLM can ingest a single prompt of 400,000 lines of code. That's just terrible programming, lol.
    *  You don’t input code into Claude Code. You allow it to lookup what it needs to when it needs to. There is, therefore, no limit to the size of your code. It’ll only read what is required to make the adjustment.

**[Claude Code native subagents vs. Claude Flow vs. BMAD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1nkha0s/claude_code_native_subagents_vs_claude_flow_vs/) (Score: 0)**
*   **Summary:** A user expresses skepticism about Claude Flow and the complexity of debugging with multiple agents.
*   **Emotion:** Neutral
*   **Top 1 Points of View:**
    *   the person who created claude flow also posted this [https://www.reddit.com/r/aipromptprogramming/comments/1l1f7nd/in\_less\_than\_a\_hour\_using\_the\_new\_perplexity\_labs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/aipromptprogramming/comments/1l1f7nd/in_less_than_a_hour_using_the_new_perplexity_labs/) so theres absolutely no reason for me to think its anything other than slop. I also dont understand how people debug and build stuff with 100 agents running around at the same time. It might just be a skill issue on my part tho
