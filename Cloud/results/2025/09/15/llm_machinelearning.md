# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D]AAAI 2026 phase1 (Score: 32)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nhpwwn/daaai_2026_phase1/)**
*  **Summary:** Discusses the AAAI 2026 Phase 1 review process, with concerns about fairness, transparency, review quality, potential collusion rings, and the impact of a large number of submissions. Some users expressed disappointment with rejected papers and the lack of feedback.
*  **Emotion:** Predominantly neutral, with some negative sentiment due to frustrations with the review process and paper rejections.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The AAAI review process lacks transparency and fairness.
    * Review quality is declining, potentially due to the large number of submissions and new reviewers.
    * Collusion rings and strategically adversarial behavior might be affecting the review outcomes.

**[[D] The quality of AAAI reviews is atrocious (Score: 8)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nhvv90/d_the_quality_of_aaai_reviews_is_atrocious/)**
*  **Summary:** Expresses concern about the quality of AAAI reviews, suggesting that reciprocal reviewing and LLM-generated reviews are contributing to the problem. Some suggest using OpenReview to let the community decide on the value.
*  **Emotion:** Primarily neutral, with some positive sentiment from those who think community review would be beneficial.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Reciprocal reviewing is a failed experiment that lowers review quality.
    * LLM-generated reviews are adding no value to the process.
    * OpenReview should be used, and the community should determine the value of a paper.

**[[R] AI Learns to Speedrun Mario in 24 Hours (2 Million Attempts!) (Score: 6)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NlwJhB8AFwg&si=0druuuZJLOqdxHoT)**
*  **Summary:** A positive discussion of reinforcement learning techniques used to train an AI to speedrun Mario, focusing on the application of curriculum learning, reward shaping, and LSTM networks.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Curriculum learning and tailored rewards are useful for addressing local optima traps.
    * Curiosity-driven reward systems could further refine the AI's performance.
    * Combining DQNs with sequence modeling (LSTM) is a powerful approach.

**[[D] Recent paddleocr version accuracy (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nhbxwk/d_recent_paddleocr_version_accuracy/)**
*  **Summary:** A user expresses that the recent paddleocr version accuracy works well for them.
*  **Emotion:** Positive.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * It works well and the accuracy has not dropped.

**[[R] r-rpe: beyond openai’s rl-hf — hedging ↓60% in eval-only tests (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1nhp54q/r_rrpe_beyond_openais_rlhf_hedging_60_in_evalonly/)**
*  **Summary:** The user raises questions about the definition of r-rpe and expresses skepticism about its approach to solving ML problems through modeling conscious beings.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
