**[Is an explicit "treatment" variable a necessary condition for instrumental variable analysis? (Score: 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nhoblg/is_an_explicit_treatment_variable_a_necessary/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion centers on the challenges of using instrumental variable analysis to determine the causal relationship between marketing spend and ad revenue, given the potential endogeneity of marketing spend and the complex interplay between users and advertisers.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, reflecting the analytical and complex nature of the problem being discussed.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Establishing a causal relationship in this scenario is difficult due to the complexity of the system and the potential for long and variable lags.
    *   Instrumental variable analysis might not be the most appropriate approach due to the endogeneity of marketing spend and the difficulty in finding a suitable instrument.
    *   Consider alternative methods such as panel data fixed effects methods, logistic regression, or leveraging existing research on Network Economics.

**[How do you factor seasonality in A/B test experiments? (Score: 6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1nhskvc/how_do_you_factor_seasonality_in_ab_test/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around different strategies for dealing with seasonality in A/B testing, including conducting tests simultaneously, using seasonal ARIMA analysis, and Triple Diff-in-Diff estimation.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, as various methods are presented and discussed without strong emotional biases. A few comments have positive or negative sentiment.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Run A/B tests simultaneously to ensure that both treatment and control groups experience the same seasonal effects.
    *   Use statistical methods like seasonal ARIMA or Triple Diff-in-Diff to control for seasonality.
    *   Seasonality doesn't matter because treatment and control group will experience the same seasonality.
