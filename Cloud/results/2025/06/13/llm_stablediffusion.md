# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[ [D] Open Source V2V Surpasses Commercial Generation (Score: 33)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1lallit/open_source_v2v_surpasses_commercial_generation/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the current state of open-source video-to-video (V2V) generation, specifically focusing on Wan. Users are reporting issues with chaining multiple outputs, attributing the problem to artifacts introduced by the VACE encode/decode process. They suggest that performing the entire generation in a single pass without intermediate encoding/decoding is crucial for maintaining quality.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Wan introduces artifacts when chaining multiple video outputs due to the VACE encode/decode process.
    *   A VACE that allows passing latents as control video or reference images is needed to avoid artifacts.
    *   The Context Options node does not effectively address the artifacting issue.
