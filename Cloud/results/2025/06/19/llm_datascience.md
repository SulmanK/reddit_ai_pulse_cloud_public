# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] What tasks don’t you trust zero-shot LLMs to handle reliably? (Score: 41)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lewya2/what_tasks_dont_you_trust_zeroshot_llms_to_handle/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread explores the limitations of zero-shot LLMs and discusses tasks for which they are not considered reliable. Users share experiences and suggest alternative approaches, like fine-tuning or using LLMs for classifications rather than direct ratings.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with users primarily sharing technical insights and experiences in an objective manner.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   LLMs are not reliable for tasks requiring deep technical expertise or complex mathematical computations.
    *   Fine-tuning LLMs generally leads to significantly higher performance compared to zero-shot approaches.
    *   LLMs can be useful for tasks like open-vocabulary multi-label classification and generating embeddings for subsequent classifiers.

**[Does anyone here do predictive modeling with scenario planning? (Score: 13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1leucnm/does_anyone_here_do_predictive_modeling_with/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread discusses the application of predictive modeling with scenario planning techniques, exploring various methods like Bayesian Belief Networks, DAGs and causal inference, and stress testing in finance.
*  **Emotion:** The thread has a mix of Positive and Neutral sentiments, with users expressing both enthusiasm for certain methods and objective descriptions of their use cases.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Bayesian Belief Networks are valuable for scenario analysis but can be challenging to implement.
    *   DAGs and causal inference are effective approaches for modeling edges and understanding relationships between variables.
    *   Bayesian methods and conjugate priors are useful for tracking information and making specific scenario-based predictions.

**[Splitting Up Modeling in Project Amongst DS Team (Score: 6)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1leyh9g/splitting_up_modeling_in_project_amongst_ds_team/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses various approaches for dividing modeling tasks within a data science team, emphasizing the importance of clear roles, communication, and standardized evaluation metrics.
*  **Emotion:**  The thread has a Neutral emotional tone, with some Positive sentiment related to collaborative review processes.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Assigning a lead developer to oversee and coordinate supporting work by other developers can improve project management.
    *   Agreeing on a standard evaluation metric and function ensures immediate confidence in reported metrics.
    *   Weekly review meetings provide an opportunity for team members to critique and learn from each other's modeling work.
