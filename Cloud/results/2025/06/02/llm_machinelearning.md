# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] TMLR paper quality seems better than CVPR, ICLR. (Score: 77)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1l1kttb/d_tmlr_paper_quality_seems_better_than_cvpr_iclr/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the perceived higher quality of papers published in TMLR compared to conferences like CVPR and ICLR. Reasons cited include a focus on correctness and completeness over novelty and SOTA (state-of-the-art) results, as well as more seasoned reviewers. Some users express frustration with the review process at the larger conferences.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone of the thread is neutral. Although some comments express positive sentiments about TMLR and negative sentiments about other conferences, the majority are factual observations.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   TMLR emphasizes correctness and completeness, attracting authors focused on scientific communication.
    *   CVPR and ICLR lack clear definitions of novelty and focus heavily on SOTA.
    *   Some researchers avoid large conferences due to unhelpful reviews, preferring TMLR's actionable feedback.

**[[D] Is overfitting still relevant in the era double descent? (Score: 36)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1l1g05b/d_is_overfitting_still_relevant_in_the_era_double/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread explores the relevance of overfitting in the context of the "double descent" phenomenon in machine learning. The discussion includes perspectives on data distributions, model size optimization, and whether overfitting is still a useful concept in modern ML.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral. There are hints of surprise and questioning about the relevance of older concepts, but most comments are informative and analytical.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Overfitting remains relevant because training data distributions are rarely identical to real-world data distributions.
    *   Larger models can provide optimal test performance even with overfitting, but it may be more practical to find a moderately sized model for faster training.
    *   Some argue that overfitting may not be relevant in the deep learning era, citing blog posts questioning its usefulness.
