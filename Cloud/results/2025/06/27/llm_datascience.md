*  **Summary:** The main point of discussion is how data science is being perceived as less rigorous, with companies prioritizing speed over validation and sometimes misinterpreting the role of AI. Many users share their negative experiences with companies implementing questionable data science practices.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mixed. While many comments express concerns and negativity about the field's direction, there's also a sense of acceptance or resignation, and some positive sentiment from newcomers who see the situation as a potential opportunity.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Data science is becoming a "pseudo-science" due to pressure for quick deployments and a lack of proper validation.
    *   Companies are prioritizing "good enough" solutions and narratives over rigorous analysis.
    *   The focus on "generative AI" sometimes leads to simplistic and flawed approaches being presented as cutting-edge.

**[Causal Inference in Sports (Score: 47)](https://medium.com/@joshamayo7/causal-inference-in-sports-7d911a248375)**
*  **Summary:**  This thread is focused on a Medium article discussing causal inference in the context of sports analytics. Commenters generally express positive feedback and ask for more resources on the topic.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is highly positive, with users expressing gratitude and interest in the article.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The article is a good resource for understanding causal inference in sports.
    *   More resources are needed for those getting started with causal inference.
    *   Causal inference techniques should be validated by randomized controlled trials.

**[CVS Heath vs JPM (Score: 9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1llvtfl/cvs_heath_vs_jpm/)**
*  **Summary:**  This thread discusses the pros and cons of working for CVS Health versus J.P. Morgan Chase as a data scientist. The discussion includes factors such as company culture, career growth, the nature of the work, and location.
*  **Emotion:** The overall tone is neutral, with a mix of positive and negative sentiments depending on the commenter's experiences and perspectives. There is some negative sentiment towards CVS Health.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   JPMC is a better option due to more opportunities in Data & Analytics and less dashboarding work compared to CVS Health.
    *   CVS Health can be a good place for career advancement if one is good at networking and playing corporate politics, but not ideal for those focused on producing high-quality analytics work.
    *   The title of VP at JPMC is often meaningless and should not be a primary consideration when choosing a job.
