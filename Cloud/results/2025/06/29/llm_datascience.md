# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Is ML/AI engineering increasingly becoming less focused on model training and more focused on integrating LLMs to build web apps? (Score: 94)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ln3zyk/is_mlai_engineering_increasingly_becoming_less/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the shift in ML/AI engineering from focusing on model training to integrating LLMs for web applications. The industry is now valuing skills like prompt engineering and system architecture to build AI-powered applications, but also some feel that it's just hype.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a mix of agreement and skepticism towards the increasing focus on LLM integration.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The field is shifting towards integrating pre-trained models like GPT-4 into real-world products.
    *   The "AI" hype is pushing businesses to integrate LLMs even when they might not be needed.
    *   While LLMs are saving costs in developing applications, the cost shifts to deployment and production, with a focus on evaluation and guardrails.

**[How’s the job market for Bayesian statistics? (Score: 79)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ln6aeq/hows_the_job_market_for_bayesian_statistics/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread discusses the job market for Bayesian statistics, its applications, and the value of domain expertise. Many consider it to not be applicable to the real world, and that frequentist methods are much more common.
*  **Emotion:** The overall tone is neutral, with some negative sentiment regarding the practical applications and job prospects related to Bayesian statistics.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Jobs hire based on domain expertise, not just tools.
    *   Sports analytics and marketing are two major applications of Bayesian statistics.
    *   Frequentist methods are more common in the real world, and Bayesian approaches are often seen as unnecessary.

**[Advice on feature selection process (Score: 16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ln9cf0/advice_on_feature_selection_process/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread provides advice on feature selection, particularly when a domain expert is involved. It suggests methods such as clustering variables, recursive feature elimination, and using SHAP values to identify overfitting features.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral to positive, offering helpful and constructive advice.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Cluster each group of variables based on their correlation matrix and take one variable with the highest information value from each cluster.
    *   Use SHAP values to identify overfitting features rather than for general feature selection.
    *   Filter out or merge highly correlated features and build a baseline model on the subset of informative features.

*  **Summary:** This thread discusses how to manage data scientists who may lack domain expertise but hold high positions and salaries.
*  **Emotion:** The thread shows a mix of frustration and solutions-oriented perspectives. Some comments show irritation, while others suggest ways to integrate these data scientists effectively.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Instead of being jealous, people with domain knowledge should work with those who have different skills to form multidisciplinary teams.
    *   Attach the data scientists to stakeholders who know how to generate value out of them, such as product or marketing teams.
    *   Challenge the proposals coming from these data scientists using SME knowledge, and try to develop projects that address real needs in the team.

**[Not sure what certifications to attain to increase my chances of getting an internship after third year (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lnbgna/not_sure_what_certifications_to_attain_to/)**
*  **Summary:** An intern asks for advice on what certifications to attain to increase their chances of getting an internship after their third year.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral. It is a straight forward question.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   What's your degree?
    *   Go for the AWS MLEA—it’s most aligned with data science and shows cloud-based ML skills.
    *   There are no other points of view.

**[Using Claude Code in notebook (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lnct9i/using_claude_code_in_notebook/)**
*  **Summary:** A discussion on using Claude code in a notebook, and if it is allowed by companies to use code in an unapproved LLM.
*  **Emotion:** Neutral with a slight tinge of caution.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   What code completion tool are you using in Jupyter?
    *   Make sure you have permission to do this. Some companies do not want you popping code into an unapproved LLM.
    *   Yes—great for debugging, refactoring, and quick iterations; share functions or snippets for focused help.
