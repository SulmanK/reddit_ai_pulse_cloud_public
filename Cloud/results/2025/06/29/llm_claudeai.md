    * Hitting limits and stopped twice on $200 plan while building and researching comprehensive MCPs with large code base plus hours debugging.

**[AIs are completely taking over my codebase - yours too? (Score: 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1lnkw3c/ais_are_completely_taking_over_my_codebase_yours/)**

*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The bottleneck is to vet the code generated by AI.
    * The poster is looking into the commit history of https://github.com/Universal-Basic-Compute/serenissima/commits/main/ but they do not understand what is happening.
    * One user humorously misinterpreted the title as AIs living as workers in XV century Venice and documenting everything through github haha

**[Why is Claude so dumb? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1lnke1q/why_is_claude_so_dumb/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread questions Claude's intelligence and seeks advice on using it effectively for coding tasks.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is primarily neutral, mixed with some negativity due to frustration with Claude's performance.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Claude's performance depends on the user's specificity in prompts and instructions.
    * Claude isn't dumb, cursor though (while good for an LLM ide) is not the best at writing code autonomously, so you should try claude desktop + mcp servers or claude code.
    * Gemini can find something that already does exactly what the user asked for, whereas Claude may be trying to make it, which means the user needs to ask Claude to show him what it obtained.
