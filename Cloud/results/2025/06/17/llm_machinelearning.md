# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Burned out mid-PhD: Is it worth pushing through to aim for a Research Scientist role, or should I pivot to industry now? (Score: 76)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ldmzms/d_burned_out_midphd_is_it_worth_pushing_through/)**
*  **Summary:** A user is feeling burned out during their PhD and is asking for advice on whether to continue towards a Research Scientist role or switch to industry.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive, with several comments offering encouragement and support. Some comments express neutral sentiments, and there's a small element of negativity.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   It's common to feel burned out during a PhD, especially in the second year.
    *   Consider taking a break or reducing pressure and discuss the situation with your advisor.
    *   Industry can also be stressful, so addressing stress-management techniques now is beneficial.

**[[D] Why Is Data Processing, Especially Labeling, So Expensive? So Many Contractors Seem Like Scammers (Score: 37)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ldaof1/d_why_is_data_processing_especially_labeling_so/)**

*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with comments providing factual information and insights into the data labeling process. There are some negative emotions expressed as well
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Data labeling is expensive because it requires domain-specific knowledge and is time-consuming.
    *   Automated labeling isn't good enough for many tasks, and human labelers are still necessary.
    *   Companies are increasingly outsourcing data labeling to contractors in developing countries.

**[[D] CausalML : Causal Machine Learning (Score: 12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ldlg92/d_causalml_causal_machine_learning/)**

**[[D] Do all algorithms produce a model? If yes, a model of what? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ldtns0/d_do_all_algorithms_produce_a_model_if_yes_a/)**
*  **Summary:** User trying to find out if all algorithms produce a model and if so, a model of what.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
