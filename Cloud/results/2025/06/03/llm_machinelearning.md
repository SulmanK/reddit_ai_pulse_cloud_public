# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Vision Language Models are Biased (Score: 78)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23941)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread discusses a paper showing that Vision Language Models (VLMs) are good at recognizing common objects, however their accuracy drops considerably when presented with counterfactual or uncommon variations, highlighting the biases present in these models.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral. The sentiment scores are predominantly neutral, with some positive contributions due to users expressing interest and sharing observations.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   VLMs are trained to correct errors, which introduces bias.
    *   VLMs struggle with counterfactual images because they rely on learned biases.
    *   There is a lack of effort in understanding and improving VLM datasets at scale.

**[[R] Soft Thinking: Unlocking the Reasoning Potential of LLMs in Continuous Concept Space (Score: 35)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1l1zp1f/r_soft_thinking_unlocking_the_reasoning_potential/)**
*  **Summary:** The thread explores the idea of using continuous concept spaces to improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs, potentially moving beyond the limitations of token-based representations.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is mixed, with neutral sentiment dominating, but with both positive sentiments expressing excitement and negative ones regarding the control problem.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The paper touches on the same issue as Yann LeCun's paper on transformer limitations, which states that transformers gain data compression and efficiency by trading away semantic richness.
    *   This approach might be a bad idea from a control perspective.
    *   Some users are optimistic and excited about the potential of AI.

**[Best way to figure out drawbacks of the methodology from a certain paper [D] (Score: 19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1l25bae/best_way_to_figure_out_drawbacks_of_the/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around effective strategies for identifying the limitations and drawbacks of methodologies presented in research papers, with recommendations on how to critically assess and practically test the proposed approaches.
*  **Emotion:** The overall tone is neutral, with users sharing practical advice and observations in a straightforward manner.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Check the number of citations. Methods that don't work reliably won't be cited often.
    *   Avoid arxiv papers unless it's something close to what you have to develop. After the paper is published in a conference/journal, it's more likely that the reviewers forced the authors to discuss the drawbacks and add ablations exploring that.
    *   Try to implement the methodology described in the paper to identify the drawbacks.

**[[D] what is the cheapest double descent experiment? (Score: 18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1l2ea55/d_what_is_the_cheapest_double_descent_experiment/)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion focuses on finding the simplest and most cost-effective methods to demonstrate the double descent phenomenon in machine learning models.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is primarily neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Run an unregularized polynomial regression in a colab notebook, with increasing degree of the polynomial for comparison.
    *   People claim it can be done with polynomials but it can be hard to make that happen.
    *   It’s quite easy to do with small datasets and piecewise linear functions

**[[D] What are your experiences with the European ELLIS program and would you recommend it? (Score: 15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1l27a0y/d_what_are_your_experiences_with_the_european/)**

    *   ELLIS is mostly about networking.
    *   ELLIS is a good club to be a member of for funding opportunities.
    *   ELLIS is a gatekeeping organization for ml insiders in European research.

**[[D]: Tensorboard alternatives (Score: 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1l2gqcn/d_tensorboard_alternatives/)**

*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Wandb is the most recommended alternative.
    *   Aim is another recommended alternative.
    *   Some users question why alternatives are being sought, as TensorBoard still exists.

**[[D] CPU time correlates with embedding entropy - related to recent thermodynamic AI work? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l2ka52)**
*  **Summary:** The discussion revolves around the potential relationship between CPU time and embedding entropy in machine learning models, possibly linking it to recent developments in thermodynamic AI research.
*  **Emotion:** The overall tone is neutral.
