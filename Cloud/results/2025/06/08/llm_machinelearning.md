# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D][R][N] Are current AI's really reasoning or just memorizing patterns well.. (Score: 179)](https://i.redd.it/4fzfjfkwlq5f1.jpeg)**
*   **Summary:** The thread explores the question of whether current AI models are truly reasoning or simply memorizing patterns. Several users share their opinions and insights, referencing research papers and real-world observations. The discussion touches on the limitations of current architectures, the role of training data, and the challenges of defining "reasoning" in the context of AI.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral. The sentiment scores are consistently close to neutral, indicating an objective and analytical discussion.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Current AI models primarily memorize patterns and lack the ability to truly reason or simulate outcomes for certain problem classes.
    *   The distinction between thinking and pattern recognition is artificial; memorizing patterns and applying them to new situations *is* reasoning.
    *   AI models memorize solution patterns due to training on reasoning chains but fall short in applying this knowledge to solve novel problems.

**[[R] Geometric Adam Optimizer (Score: 61)](https://github.com/jaepil/geometric-adam)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses a new optimizer called "Geometric Adam." Users are discussing the optimizer's performance, suggesting testing methodologies, and comparing it to existing state-of-the-art optimizers like AdamW and Muon. Some users question the validity of the associated research paper, while others ask about the model architecture used for testing.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral. Although, some comments show positive sentiment, the discussion remains largely objective and focused on technical aspects of the optimizer.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The new optimizer needs to be tested in a competitive setting against established training regimes and state-of-the-art optimizers.
    *   The associated research paper might be LLM-generated and therefore suspicious.
    *   The user used LLMs to translate his non-native English sentences.

**[[R] Machine learning with hard constraints: Neural Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAEs) as a general formalism (Score: 37)](https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/machine-learning-with-hard-constraints-neural-differential-algebraic-equations-daes-as-a-general-formalism/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread focuses on the use of Neural Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAEs) for machine learning with hard constraints. The discussion centers around the approach's ability to handle noise and whether it's possible to learn the constraints.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral. The thread presents a rather analytical discussion with no strong positive or negative emotions.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Noise can lead to overfitting of the algebraic equation, similar to algebraic approaches to manifold learning/dimensional reduction.
    *   Question of whether it is possible to learn the constraints.

**[[D] is there a mistake in the RoPE embedding paper? (Score: 35)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1l6bbyn/d_is_there_a_mistake_in_the_rope_embedding_paper/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses a possible mistake in the RoPE embedding paper, specifically the potential missing transpose operator in an equation.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral. The users seem to be fact-finding and asking questions more than expressing any emotional viewpoints.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   There appears to be a missing transpose operator in an equation.
    *   Unsure if the error affects later uses in the paper.

**[[D] The illusion of "The Illusion of Thinking" (Score: 22)](https://www.seangoedecke.com/illusion-of-thinking/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the limitations of using puzzles, specifically the Tower of Hanoi, as a metric for evaluating the "reasoning" abilities of AI models. Users suggest that the limitations of models on puzzle-solving may be due to constraints on the model from the training and implementation process.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Positive to Neutral. Some users expressed positive sentiment about the existence of the counter-argument.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Puzzles are not a good metric for evaluating AI reasoning as they don't accurately reflect real-world executive functioning.
    *   Models are rewarded to not produce absurdly large answers, therefore the issues in this test could be linked to penalization of infinite generation.
    *   Models fumble even when given the full Tower of Hanoi algorithm in the prompt, making the term "reasoning model" a legal liability.

**[[P] BERT-Emotion: Lightweight Transformer Model (~20MB) for Real-Time Emotion Detection (Score: 5)](https://i.redd.it/rdx2534iho5f1.jpeg)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses a lightweight BERT model (~20MB) for real-time emotion detection. The discussion centers around whether the model offers anything special compared to standard BERT models and the lack of proper evaluation against similar models. One user raises the point about the model's inability to handle mixed emotions related to different subjects.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral to Negative. One comment expresses a negative sentiment regarding the model's limitations in handling mixed emotions.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The model appears to be a standard BERT model without any special features.
    *   There is a lack of proper evaluation with similar models.
    *   The model struggles with mixed emotions related to different subjects in a text.
