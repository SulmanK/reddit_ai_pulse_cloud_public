# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[New requirements for junior data engineers are challenging. (Score: 64)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l6b8g6/new_requirements_for_junior_data_engineers_are/)**
*  **Summary:**  The discussion revolves around the increasing demands being placed on junior data engineers, with many feeling that requirements are inflated and often seek senior-level skills for junior pay. The blurring lines between data engineering, MLOps, and data science roles are also discussed.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is Neutral. While there is frustration expressed, the overall sentiment remains objective and informative.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Companies are expecting MLOps skills from junior data engineers without adequate compensation.
    *   Job requirements are often unrealistic and written by individuals unfamiliar with the actual job duties.
    *   It's advisable to apply for positions even if you don't meet all the listed requirements, as job descriptions are often a "hodgepodge of industry buzzwords."

**[As Europe eyes move from US hyperscalers, IONOS dismisses scaleability worries -- "The world has changed. EU hosting CTO says not considering alternatives is 'negligent'" (Score: 34)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/06/ionos_dismisses_scalability_worries_interview/)**
*  **Summary:**  The discussion centers on Europe's potential shift away from US hyperscalers like AWS, GCP, and Azure, with IONOS expressing confidence in its scalability. Some users are skeptical about Europe's ability to create competitive alternatives.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotion is Neutral, presenting a factual discussion on the feasibility and implications of Europe developing its own cloud infrastructure.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Europe is too late to create its own AWS/GCP/Azure equivalent.
    *   There's a need for alternatives to specific services like AWS DynamoDB, Google Spanner, or Azure CosmosDB.
    *   Past attempts by European executives to create alternatives to US clouds have not materialized effectively.

**[Migrating SSIS to Python: Seeking Project Structure & Package Recommendations (Score: 11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l6bmmx/migrating_ssis_to_python_seeking_project/)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread is about migrating from SSIS to Python for data pipelines. Users discussed various approaches, including using dbt-core, Airflow, and simple Python scripts with cron, along with project structure and package recommendations.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mixed, with elements of positive suggestions and some negativity towards over-engineering and complexity. However, the dominant tone remains Neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Using dbt-core can simplify the migration process and provide a good project structure.
    *   For basic scheduling needs, simple Python scripts with cron might be sufficient and prevent over-engineering.
    *   Consider ADF hosted Airflow for a more robust solution, although Airflow itself is considered basic.

**[Data Analytics Automation (Score: 5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l6ekjd/data_analytics_automation/)**
*  **Summary:**  This discussion is about automating data analytics tasks. Participants suggested using Python, cloud schedulers, and orchestrators like Airflow depending on the complexity and needs.
