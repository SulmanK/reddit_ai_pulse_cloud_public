**[[D] Why NFL theorem holds even when we average with a fixed f (fixed problem)? (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lef4wz/d_why_nfl_theorem_holds_even_when_we_average_with/)**

*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   For every problem and algorithm there's another problem where the algorithm performance is exactly reversed which is easy to prove by just flipping the labels in the test set. With this you can generalize that over all problems all the algorithms have the same performance
    *   You can't adjust to the test set because you don't see it at training.
    *   All expectations are taken either over f (target functions) or phi (restricted family of target function) in Wolpert's 1996 paper.

**[CPU for AI Workstation (to be paired with RTX 5090) [D] (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lefsbq/cpu_for_ai_workstation_to_be_paired_with_rtx_5090/)**

*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Workstation CPUs like Xeon-W or AMD Threadripper are recommended due to their superior memory bandwidth and PCIe lane availability compared to consumer platforms. Xeon-W is particularly favored for AMX acceleration.
    *   Contrary to workstation CPU recommendations, a high-end CPU with integrated graphics, like Intel i9 or AMD Ryzen 9 X3D, is suggested to free up VRAM by using the iGPU for UI rendering, allowing the main GPU to be fully dedicated to calculations.
    *   Sapphire Rapids (Xeon-W) is a stable and well tested platform with AMX acceleration, 8-channel DDR5 and a mess of PCIe 5.0 lanes (over 100). You can also get refurbished HP Z workstations for a good price.
