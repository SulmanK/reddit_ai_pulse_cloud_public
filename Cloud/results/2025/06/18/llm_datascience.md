*  **Summary:** The post discusses the lack of statistics and probability in some Data Science programs, with many commenters agreeing it's a problem and questioning the quality of such programs. The importance of a strong foundation in math and stats for data science is emphasized.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is mostly neutral, expressing concern and skepticism about the quality of data science programs. Some comments also express frustration with the perceived "scam" nature of some programs.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Data Science programs should include a solid foundation in statistics and probability, including topics like Central Limit Theorem, hypothesis testing, and probability distributions.
    *   Many Data Science programs are considered "cash grabs" and may not provide adequate training for students.
    *   A good Data Science program should be a combination of statistics and software engineering.

**[I got ghosted after 8 interviews. Why do companies do this? (Score: 78)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1lenpta/i_got_ghosted_after_8_interviews_why_do_companies/)**
*  **Summary:** The post describes being ghosted after a very lengthy interview process and asks for possible reasons, with commenters sharing similar experiences and criticizing companies' behavior. The length of the interview process itself is seen as a red flag.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone is negative, reflecting frustration and disappointment with the job application process.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Being ghosted after multiple interviews is a sign of a company's poor culture and lack of respect for candidates' time.
    *   A very long interview process (8 rounds or more) is often a red flag, indicating weak leadership or an inefficient decision-making process.
    *   Candidates should not put up with excessive interview rounds and should consider withdrawing from such processes.
