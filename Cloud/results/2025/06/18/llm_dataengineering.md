**[what is the best way to learn new tables/databases. (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1leplq3/what_is_the_best_way_to_learn_new_tablesdatabases/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread is asking for advice on how to learn new tables and databases.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Generate the DDL or the ERD for all of them using your SQL client.
    *   As an intern, you need to understand the database that your project is on. You need to study the DDL and ERD to understand how the tables are connected. There are free diagramming tools that you can manually build an ERD.
    *   I built [ToolFront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront) to help me with these types of tasks. I hook it up with Cursor, and it helps me explore & understand large databases and data lakes.
