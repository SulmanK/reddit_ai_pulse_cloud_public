*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Ensure you‚Äôre in your feature branch with git checkout feature/streaming-pipelines, and then do git fetch origin/development to update your local tracking branches, followed by git merge origin/development to merge the remote changes into your feature branch.
    *   You should just be able to merge development to your feature branch.
    *   I would always recommend performing a rebase instead of merging.
