    *   You're `spitting venom on the web`! Tempting idea.
    *   Im probably going to do something similar soon. CC seems to be pretty good at refactoring. It has helped me spot major inefficiencies cursor introduced probably due to not having full context like claude seems to
    *   Remember to a/b test or canary release it. Claude can refactor well but it does it convincingly well such that the bugs are usually hard to spot

    *   Bro, has been working for 3 months... He just finished his probationary period. Let him work.
    *   At first I did but over time I have learned that these things are just software playing the chinese room experiment via statistics. Now I find it weird to feel bad for them, that's like feeling bad for your calculator or your auto-correct software because they work too hard.
