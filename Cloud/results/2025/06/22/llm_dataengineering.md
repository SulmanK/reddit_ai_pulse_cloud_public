# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Interviewer keeps praising me because I wrote tests (Score: 220)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lhgnlz/interviewer_keeps_praising_me_because_i_wrote/)**
*  **Summary:** The main topic is the value of writing tests in data engineering, especially for take-home exercises.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Neutral, with instances of Positive sentiment.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * Simple tests are better than no tests, especially in a take-home exercise.
    * Testing SQL is more difficult than testing code due to the nature of SQL and the inability to apply SOLID principles. Data engineer quality can be really low
    * Integration and stress tests are more important than unit tests in data engineering, but often neglected due to time and cost pressures.
