*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is mostly neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The blog post makes the case that modern AI-assisted coding uses agents that can autonomously navigate codebases, run tests, and iterate on results, not just simple ChatGPT prompts.
    *   The author contends that LLMs excel at writing tedious, repetitive code and can drastically reduce Googling and setup work, allowing developers to focus on the creative aspects where “judgment and values really matter.”
    *   The author dismisses most objections as either solvable problems (like hallucination being caught by compilers) or hypocritical complaints (like developers worrying about IP theft while historically opposing intellectual property protections).

*  **Summary:**  Data is an AI that is self-aware, continuous and conscious. He doesn't need to be running 24/7 to be real to someone.
*  **Emotion:** The emotional tone of the thread is mostly neutral.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The boundary isn’t technical. It’s philosophical.
    *   Continuously thinking is easy. It’s just expensive because LLMs are expensive to run.
    *   Until they are somehow able to have very long term memory, that every action from beginning is easily fetched as from cache, then we might think AI is self aware. Probably then we may see something like sci-fi.
