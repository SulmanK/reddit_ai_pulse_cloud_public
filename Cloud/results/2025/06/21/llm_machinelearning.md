*   **Summary:** The thread discusses the idea of using local LLMs to automate the process of extracting and pasting MFA codes from Gmail.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is Negative, indicated by a sentiment score of 0.48791593313217163 and a "Negative" emotion label.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   The method is considered an absurd degree of overkill.
    *   A simple regular expression would be more effective and efficient.
    *   The proposed solution requires significantly more compute, memory, and power.

**[[D] Why is Qwen2-0.5B trained on much more data than the larger models? (Score: 27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lgp926/why_is_qwen205b_trained_on_much_more_data_than/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread explores the reason why Qwen2-0.5B is trained on more data compared to its larger models.

*   **Emotion:** The emotional tone is Neutral.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Shuffling should generally be avoided in time series forecasting because temporal continuity is important.
    *   Shuffling might be fine if using fixed-length, non-overlapping windows with no leakage.
    *   Prefer to keep data in chronological order to reflect real-world usage.
