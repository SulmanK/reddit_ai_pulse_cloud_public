# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[D] Vicious circle of misplaced expectations with *** and stakeholders (Score: 14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1l843cd/vicious_circle_of_misplaced_expectations_with_pms/)**
*   **Summary:** Stakeholders treat data science like it's a plug-and-play module that should just output magic insights. The lack of two-way communication early on means DS is never really solving the right problem. The way out is cultural and operational change.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is negative, reflecting frustration with the situation.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Data Science is being treated as a plug-and-play module.
    *   Product managers make promises on behalf of DS without consulting them.
    *   The solution involves better communication and setting realistic expectations.

**[Can someone explain to me the difference between Fitting aggregation functions and regular old linear regression? (Score: 11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1l7knce/can_someone_explain_to_me_the_difference_between/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread is a discussion on the differences between fitting aggregation functions and regular old linear regression. Aggregation returns a summary while Linear Regression is predictive.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, focused on providing explanations.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Aggregation functions return a summary statistic for queried data.
    *   Fitting a linear regression is about predicting new values with the input features.
    *   Statistical regression extrapolates about a broader population from a few data points.

**[What Masters should could be an option after B.Sc Data Science (Score: 0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1l7spck/what_masters_should_could_be_an_option_after_bsc/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread discusses potential Master's degree options for someone with a Bachelor of Science in Data Science, with suggestions including applied stats, computer science, or gaining work experience before pursuing further education.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, offering advice and opinions.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   A masters in the same topic wouldn't really benefit the person.
    *   Consider a master's degree in either CS/Stats/Applied Stats or something quantitative.
    *   Get a job first and see what you'd like to pursue your career in.
