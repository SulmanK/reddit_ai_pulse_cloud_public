# Detailed Analysis by Thread
**[[R] WiFiGPT: Using fine-tuned LLM for Indoor Localization Using Raw WiFi Signals (arXiv:2505.15835) (Score: 21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lfu9bk/r_wifigpt_using_finetuned_llm_for_indoor/)**
*   **Summary:** This thread discusses the application of a fine-tuned language model (LLM) to the task of indoor localization using raw WiFi signals. Users debate the validity of using an LLM for this task, compare it to existing RF-based methods, and inquire about the team's expertise in RF.
*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, with a mix of curiosity, skepticism, and technical questioning.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Skepticism about using an LLM for a regression problem like indoor localization, suggesting it's not the most appropriate method.
    *   The importance of comparing the LLM-based approach with classical RF solutions like beamforming and considering WiFi mesh networks.
    *   Questioning the team's RF knowledge and the potential "laziness" of using an LLM instead of a traditional data parser.

**[Built a cloud GPU price comparison service [P] (Score: 21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lg0ywo/built_a_cloud_gpu_price_comparison_service_p/)**
